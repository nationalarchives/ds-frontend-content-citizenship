        A criminal who had claimed <a href="#sanctuary">sanctuary<img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a> could confess 
        his crime and agree to leave the country. After abjuring (renouncing)

      <p><span class="glossary"><a name="abolition"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>Abolition movement </span><br>
        Leading figures of the anti-slavery movement in Britain included the Yorkshire 
        MP William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson (who devoted most of his life 
        to the movement) and the former slave Olaudah Equiano (Gustavus Vassa). 
        The Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded in 1787, 
        and the Anti-Slavery Society in 1823. After vigorous campaigning, the 
        British slave trade was abolished in stages, starting with the Atlantic 
        slave trade in 1807. Slavery was abolished in the British West Indies 
        and Cape Colony (South Africa) on 1 August 1834, leading the way to the 
        abolition of slavery in other British colonies during the 19th and 20th 
        centuries.</p>

        <br>
        Pressure group founded in 1839 by 'free traders' Richard Cobden and John 
        Bright to campaign for the repeal of the 'corn laws'. Regulations forbidding 
        grain exports had been introduced as early as the 14th century. Although 
        much legislation followed, in this context 'corn laws' refers to the measures 
        introduced in the late 18th and early 19th century. When domestic prices 
        reached specified levels, grain exports were prohibited. Alternatively, 
        to ensure artificially high prices, import duties were imposed on grain 
        coming into the country. The result was that grain cheaper than domestic 
        price levels was discouraged and bread became expensive.</p>
      <p><a name="assizes"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a><span class="glossary">Assizes</span><br>
        An assize trial was a trial by jury. In its most settled and enduring 
        form 'the assizes' meant the routine of bringing royal justice to various 
        parts of the country. Two commissioners travelled one of six circuits 
        twice a year during the vacations of the royal courts at Westminster. 
        The commissioners were given powers to 'hear and determine' criminal cases, 
        try or release prisoners in gaols ('gaol delivery'), and hear civil cases 
        that would otherwise have come to the royal courts. See also <a href="#oyer">Oyer

        Joint declaration made by Roosevelt and Churchill in August 1941, setting 
        out broad principles for the conduct of international relations in the 
        postwar world. Drawn up at sea, off the coast of Newfoundland, it provided 
        a foundation for the United Nations Charter. Its eight principles included 
        non-aggression, self-determination, free trade, freedom of the seas, and 
        renunciation of territorial expansion. </p>
      <span class="glossary"><a name="attainder"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>Attainder</span> <br>
      In medieval times, the extinction of civil rights took place when judgement 
      of death or <a href="#outlawry">outlawry<img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a> was recorded against a person 
      who had committed treason or a felony. It involved the forfeiture and reversion 
      to the Crown of the land and goods belonging to the person attainted. It 
      could also result from a Bill of Attainder brought against an individual 
      in Parliament.

      <p><a name="benefit"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a><span class="glossary">Benefit of clergy</span><br>
        A legal fiction extensively used prior to the 18th century, whereby a 
        claim to being a member of the clergy allowed a person sentenced to death 
        to be branded (burned in the hand) and discharged.</p>
      <p><span class="glossary"><a name="black"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>Black Death</span> <br>

        Originally, a formal written record of a grant. Royal charters were used 
        to confer status (e.g. that of borough or city) and to grant rights and 
        privileges to institutions such as banks, colleges and <a href="#guilds">guilds<img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>.

        In 1838, the 'People's Charter' was drafted by William Lovett, one of 
        the founders of the London Working Men's Association. The resulting movement 
        was at the centre of the demands for parliamentary reform during the late 
        1830s and throughout the 1840s. The Chartists' six main demands were: 
        votes for all men; equal electoral districts; abolition of the requirement 
        that Members of Parliament be property owners; payment for MPs; annual 
        general elections; secret ballots. Chartism also promoted the cause of 
        trade unions and factory reform, and was vehemently against the new Poor 
        Law. See also <a href="struggle_democracy/lovell.htm" target="_blank" onClick="PRO_displayInMainWindow('struggle_democracy/lovell.htm',false);return document.MM_returnValue">John

        <br>
        Legislation introduced in 1661-5 in order to repress nonconformism and 
        ensure the supremacy of the Church of England. Named after the Lord Chancellor, 
        Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, although he objected to its harshness, 
        it consisted of the Corporation Act, the Act of Uniformity, the Conventicle 
        Act and the Five Mile Act. See <a href="rise_parliament/religious.htm" target="_blank" onClick="PRO_displayInMainWindow('rise_parliament/religious.htm',false);return document.MM_returnValue">Religious

      <p><a name="close"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt=""width="1" height="1" border="0"></a><span class="glossary">Close writ</span> <br>
        A writ under the Great Seal sent folded and closed by the seal on the 
        outside, so its contents could be read only by the person or persons to 
        whom it was addressed. Unclosed letters, proclamations or writs issued 
        under the Great Seal were termed 'patent'. These were open, with the seal 
        appended on a tag or cord, so the text could be read by any literate person.</p>

        <br>
        From late medieval times, 'incorporated' boroughs (i.e. those enjoying 
        corporate status) were governed by municipal corporations entitled to 
        pass by-laws, hold land and use a common seal. They could also sue and 
        be sued. Urban government was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Acts 
        of 1835 and 1882, which standardised regulations concerning the election 
        of councillors and aldermen and the appointment and responsibilities of 
        mayors.</p>

        The granting of limited rights of citizenship to a denizen - a person 
        habitually dwelling in a foreign country. In England, from the 16th century 
        denization was granted by<a href="#letters"> letters patent<img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>.</p>

        <br>
        Between 1536 and 1540 Henry VIII ordered the closure of the religious 
        houses of England and Wales (around 800 monasteries, nunneries and friaries). 
        He claimed their property on the false grounds that the Crown had founded 
        them all. Henry at first added to the existing Crown lands and sold some 
        of the land to his supporters; later he sold more monastic land to fund 
        his wars with France. </p>

      <p><span class="glossary"><a name="enclosure"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>Enclosure </span><br>
        The process of enclosing (with hedges, ditches, fences, etc.) open lands 
        that had formerly been subject to common rights. Farmers found it difficult 
        to introduce farming innovations on scattered strips of land subject to 
        such rights, and larger holdings were built up over several centuries 
        of consolidation and enclosure. Between the 1730s and 1830s enclosure 
        was authorised by individual Acts of Parliament, as well as through the 
        earlier formal and informal agreements of landowners. Although enclosure 
        promoted modern farming methods, the reduction and elimination of common 
        rights was devastating for many smallholders and wage workers.</p>

        <br>
        Britain's only republican period during the past 1,000 years. Established 
        following the execution of Charles I, it lasted until the Restoration 
        in 1660. It included the 'Commonwealth or Free-State' declared by the

        Grants of subsidies or taxes to the Crown for extraordinary purposes, 
        such as the knighting of the king's son, the marriage of his daughter, 
        or to ransom the king if he was captured. These were linked to the structure 
        of feudal lordship, since Magna Carta had determined that a lord could 
        demand such contributions from his inferiors on only three occasions. 
        Some kings manipulated the right by retrospectively claiming such feudal 
        taxes during times of greater need.</p>

        <br>
        Under the feudal system, a lord granted land (known as a 'fee' or 'fief') 
        to a servant in return for military service and other obligations. These 
        privileges, burdens and customs, attached to land, office, estates or 
        manors, were known as feudal incidents. They included such practices as 
        the royal right to <a href="#wardships">wardship<img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a> and the payment of 
        a fine (called 'livery of lands') upon an heir's entry into inherited

        A system of landholding, common throughout Europe in medieval times, whereby

        Guilds were medieval associations consisting of the chief traders of a 
        town. The early merchant guilds excluded craftworkers. The later craft 
        guilds therefore sought to include employers, day workers (journeymen) 
        and apprentices. The aim of the guilds was to regulate wages, prices and 
        the number of apprentices entering the trade, as well as upholding standards 
        of workmanship.</p>

        is lawful. The right of any citizen to obtain the issue of such a writ 
        is regarded as one of the most fundamental civil liberties. In England, 
        writs beginning with the instruction 'Habeas corpus' (Latin for 'Have 
        the body&#8230;', meaning 'You are to produce the person detained') were 
        first issued in the 13th century. The law relating to them was formalised

        A form of contract between two or more parties. Originally, such deeds

        then cut in such a way that the matching of the pieces could be used as 
        a test of authenticity. Contracts of service for soldiers, servants, apprentices 
        and employees were often drawn up in the form of indentures.</p>

      The movement - both in Scotland and England and 'over the water' in France 
      - to restore James II and his descendants to the throne (Jacobus being Latin 
      for James). There were three main Jacobite risings: in 1689-90, in support 
      of James himself; in 1715, in support of his son James Francis Edward Stuart 
      (the 'Old Pretender'); and in 1745-6, led by Charles Edward Stuart (the 
      'Young Pretender'), more popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie.

        Supporters of the House of Lancaster, descending from John of Gaunt, Duke

        deposed Richard II to become Henry IV, the first king of the new dynasty.

        in 1471 by Edward IV. However, when Henry Tudor (Henry VII) defeated the

        Richard, Duke of Gloucester, persuaded Parliament to endorse his claim 
        to the crown and he ascended the throne as Richard III. Skeletons, believed 
        to be those of the two princes, were unearthed at the Tower in 1674 and 
        interred in Westminster Abbey. Whether they were murdered on the orders 
        of Richard III or Henry VII is still a matter of debate.</p>

      for most activities. They could sue anyone at law except their lord. Although 
      a lord protected his villeins (like any of his valuable possessions), villeinage 
      was a form of slavery that gave those bound very few rights and their quality 
      of life depended on the benevolence of his rule.

      <p><span class="glossary"><a name="wardships"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>Wardships</span> <br>
        A ward was a minor (under the age of 21) who was placed in the care of 
        a guardian. For those wards who were children of tenants in chief (those 
        holding land directly from the Crown, and therefore normally heirs to 
        large estates), the Crown had the right to their wardship. This was usually 
        granted for a large fee to a nobleman or other aristocrat who would ensure 
        that the ward was educated and protected appropriately until coming of 
        age. Wardships were also frequently sold with the right to marry the heir. 
        Since very often this meant marriage within the guardian's family, the 
        manipulation of wardships could affect the balance of landholding society. 
        Henry VIII established the Court of Wards and Liveries in 1541 to regulate 
        the system of wardships and inheritances.</p>
      <p><span class="glossary"><a name="wars"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>Wars of the Roses</span> <br>
        The bitter intermittent struggle between the royal houses of York and 
        Lancaster for the crown of England. The Wars of the Roses are traditionally 
        regarded as beginning with the first Battle of St Albans in 1455 and concluding 
        with Henry VII's victory against the Yorkist claimant, John, Earl of Lincoln, 
        at the Battle of Stoke in 1487. So called because the emblem of the <a href="#yorkists">Yorkists<img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a> 
        was a white rose and that of the <a href="#lancastrians">Lancastrians<img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a> 
        a red rose.</p>
      <p><span class="glossary"><a name="whigs"><img src="graphics/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></a>Whigs</span> <br>
        In the late 17th century, those opposed to the religious policies of Charles 
        II and the succession of his Catholic brother James, Duke of York (later 
        James II) were nicknamed 'Whigs'. By the early 18th century, the Whigs 
        had become a loose political alliance made up of members of the aristocracy 
        and the moneyed middle classes that supported the Hanoverian settlement. 
        From the late 18th century, the Whigs favoured some measure of political 
        reform, and this connection with parliamentary change was reinforced with 
        the 1832 Reform Act. They came to adopt the term 'Liberals' quite early 
        in the 19th century, although official usage dates from the 1860s.</p>

        An official paper outlining the government's policy on a matter to be 
        brought before Parliament. A green paper is a more provisional document, 
        intended to initiate or stimulate debate.</p>

        Supporters of the House of York. The Yorkist dynasty claimed descent through 
        the third and fifth sons of Edward III: Lionel, Duke of Clarence, and 
        Edmund, Duke of York. The first Yorkist monarch was Edward IV - son of 
        Richard, 3rd Duke of York (1411-60) and <a href="citizen_subject/neville.htm" onClick="PRO_displayInMainWindow('citizen_subject/neville.htm',false);return document.MM_returnValue">Cecily

        forces at the Battle of Towton in 1461. In 1483 Edward IV's brother, Richard, 
        Duke of Gloucester, usurped the throne to become Richard III. He was defeated 
        at the battle of Bosworth by Henry Tudor (Henry VII) in 1485. See also
