          <td> <p>Published in two parts, in 1791 and 1792, Thomas Paine's <em>Rights 
              of Man</em> was a direct rebuke to Edmund Burke's condemnation of 
              the French Revolution. The book proposed a more democratic and open 
              process of politics, and sought to provide a programme for equal 
              political rights. Paine argued that unless parliament was controlled 
              by a majority of ordinary people it would never work in the majority's 
              interests and, in colourful language, emphasised the evils of hereditary 
              government: 'A banditti of ruffians overrun a country, and lay it 
              under contributions. Their power being thus established, the chief 
              of the band contrived to lose the name of robber in that of Monarch; 
              and hence the origin of Monarchy and Kings.'</p>
            <p>Paine recommended that men over 21 should have the vote, that the 
              House of Lords should be abolished, and that taxation should be 
              graduated and based on wealth. He also advocated the introduction 
              of old age pensions ('not as a matter of grace and favour, but of 
              right') and maternity grants.</p>
            <p>Paine renounced any profits from the book, making possible cheap 
              editions, which allowed the book to reach a large working-class 
              readership. It is almost impossible to overestimate the importance 
              of <em>Rights of Man</em>. It gave huge encouragement to the corresponding 
              societies and other radical groups of the 1790s and beyond. The 
              second part (which appeared in 1792) was thought by contemporaries 
              to have sold 200,000 copies, and by the time of his death in 1809 
              it is estimated that 1,500,000 copies had been sold throughout Europe. 
              The readership was in fact undoubtedly much higher, as copies were 
              passed around between groups of people and sections of the book 
              were read out aloud to stimulate discussions at political meetings.<br>
