          <td colspan="2">When we survey the wretched condition of man under the 
            monarchical and hereditary systems of Government, dragged from his 
            home by one power, or driven by another, and impoverished by taxes 
            more than by enemies, it becomes evident that those systems are bad, 
            and that a general revolution in the principle and construction of 
            Governments is necessary.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td colspan="2">What is Government more than the management of the affairs 
            of a Nation? It is not, and from its nature cannot be, the property 
            of any particular man or family, but of the whole community, at whose 
            expence it is supported; and though by force or contrivance it has 
            been usurped into an inheritance, the usurpation cannot alter the 
            right of things. Sovereignty, as a matter of right, appertains to 
            the Nation only, and not to any individual; and a Nation has at all 
            times an inherent indefeasible right to abolish any form of Government 
            it finds inconvenient, and establish such as accords with its interest, 
            disposition, and happiness. The romantic and barbarous distinction 
            of men into Kings and subjects, though it may suit the condition of 
            courtiers, cannot that of citizens; and is exploded by the principle 
            upon which Governments are now founded. Every citizen is a member 
            of the sovereignty, and, as such, can acknowledge no personal subjection, 
            and his obedience can be only to the laws.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td colspan="2">When men think of what Government is, they must necessarily 
            suppose it to possess a knowledge of all the objects and matters upon 
            which its authority is to be exercised. In this view of Government, 
            the republican system, as established by America and France, operates 
            to embrace the whole of a Nation, and the knowledge necessary to the 
            interest of all the parts, is to be found in the center, which the 
            parts by representation form: But the old Governments are on a construction 
            that excludes knowledge as well as happiness: Government by Monks, 
            who know nothing of the world beyond the walls of a Convent, is as 
            consistent as government by Kings.</td>

          <td colspan="2">What were formerly called Revolutions, were little more 
            than a change of persons, or an alteration of local circumstances. 
            They rose and fell like things of course, and had nothing in their 
            existence or their fate that could influence beyond the spot that 
            produced them. But what we now see in the world, from the Revolutions 
            of America and France, is a renovation of the natural order of things, 
            a system of principles as universal as truth and the existence of 
            man, and combining moral with political happiness and national prosperity.</td>

          <td colspan="2">&quot; I. Men are born and always continue free, and

            are liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression.</td>

          <td colspan="2">In these principles, there is nothing to throw a nation 
            into confusion by inflaming ambition. They are calculated to call 
            forth wisdom and abilities, and to exercise them for the public good, 
            and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular descriptions 
            of men or families. Monarchical sovereignty, the enemy of mankind, 
            and the source of misery, is abolished; and sovereignty itself is 
            restored to its natural and original place, the Nation. Were this 
            the case throughout Europe, the cause of wars would be taken away.</td>
