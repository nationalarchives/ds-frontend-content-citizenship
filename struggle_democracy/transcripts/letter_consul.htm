            no doubt, already aware, that a large number of Citizens of the United 
            States have recently been arrested and thrown into prison, without 
            sworn informations against them or the slightest allegation of their 
            guilt as I am informed. Many alleged cases of great hardship and unjustifiable 
            harshness have been brought before me in the execution of the law 
            by which the Habeas Corpus Act has been so suddenly suspended, and 
            acted on without even an intimation that American Citizens would be 
            made liable thereto, indiscriminately, and by which they might have 
            been afforded the opportunity of leaving a country in which their 
            liberties would be endangered even tho' they had transgressed no law 
            that would justify their imprisonment. And altho' there may be grounds 
            of suspicion of complicity with treasonable objects against some of 
            those who have been thus deprived of their liberty yet, in all likelihood, 
            many of them have not been guilty of any designs to subvert the civil 
            order established in this Realm, and therefore justly complain of 
            the treatment they have experienced from the authorities of this kingdom.</td>
