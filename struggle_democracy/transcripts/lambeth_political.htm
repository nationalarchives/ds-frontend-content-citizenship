          <td>The aristocratical government under which this country groans can 
            only be subdued and changed by constant and vigorous efforts on the 
            part of the people. Unless the controlling power of the State shall 
            be speedily rendered decidedly popular, there is little hope that 
            property can be made secure, industry free, and labour protected against 
            the aggressions of the powerful. To call the present electoral system 
            a Representation of the People is at once a fraud and a mockery. The 
            House of Commons, though pretending to represent the people of this 
            country, is chosen by a a narrow class nominally of &pound;10 householders, 
            who do not amount in number to more than ONE SIXTH part of the adult 
            male inhabitants of the United Kingdom; whilst from the difficulties 
            interposed in the way of registrations, scarcely a third of those 
            persons who are actually &pound;10 householders have attained the 
            electoral franchise. The consequences are that a selfish, short-sighted, 
            and tyrannical aristocracy, and a few greedy class interests reign 
            supreme in the Legislature, the rights of the people are contemned, 
            and wasteful expenditure, imbecility, and a misrule characterise the 
            administration of the British Government in all parts of the British 
            empire. To this system the Ministers of the Crown again declare their 
            intention to adhere. The complaints and demands of the people are 
            unnoticed or despised. The recent Speech of the executive chief magistrate 
            studiously avoids even a reference to most of the topics which agitate 
            every city, town, and village in Great Britain; and notices one of 
            them only to threaten persecution and legal penalties. To aid in obtaining 
            the redress of such grievances, the LAMBETH POLITICAL UNION was formed. 
            That Union maintains &quot;that every male person of full age, sane 
            mind, and unconvicted of crime, ought to have a vote in the election 
            of representatives in the House of Commons; that such representatives 
            ought to be chosen for one year only; that the requirement of any 
            Property Qualification for such representatives, inasmuch as it limits 
            the choice of electors, is unjust, and ought to be abolished; that 
            adequate salaries ought to be paid to the representatives of the people 
            from the national Treasury; that electoral districts, containing as 
            nearly as may be, equal numbers of adult male inhabitants, ought to 
            be formed, and that all elections of members to the House of Commons 
            all votes ought to be taken by Ballot.&quot; And further, &quot;That 
            the people of the United Kingdom should have full liberty to dispose 
            of the produce of their labour, their capital, and their land to the 
            best advantage, and therefore all restrictive, discriminating, and 
            prohibitory duties ought to be absolutely abolished.&quot;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>In carrying out these principles the Lambeth Political Union seeks 
            to unite liberal and just men of all classes; - disclaiming alike 
            all exclusive objects of any one class which shall be inconsistent 
            with the JUST RIGHTS of any other, - anxious to join in one common 
            political effort the energies of the masses and the influences of 
            property, employers and employed, capitalists and workmen, - it will 
            endeavour to do so by all legal and practical means. For that purpose 
            the Lambeth Political Union will urge the abolition of all restrictions 
            upon the Press; more ready interchange of thought, by the adoption 
            of a uniform Penny Postage; the superintendence of the Registration 
            of Electors with the Borough of Lambeth; appeals and instructions 
            to those who can, by some legal contrivance or personal exertion, 
            be placed upon the register of voters; the support of candidates who 
            will pledge themselves to the popular principles of the Union; the 
            reformation of local and parochial abuses; and, above all, by the 
            incessant agitation of the Borough through addresses and public meetings.</td>
