          <td colspan="2" valign="top">TO prevent that abominable measure of Roman 
            Catholic Emancipation, I presented a requisition to the Sheriff for 
            a Meeting on the subject, signed by one hundred respectable names. 
            Supposing what might be the fate of the same, and the reason he would 
            assign for his refusal, I endeavoured to shew him what was the sense 
            of the County in regard to his conduct, in case of his obstinate denial; 
            and also to propose a vote of impeachment against the Duke of Wellington 
            and Mr. Peel. Upon this a bastard Whig Magistrate, a friend to Roman 
            Catholic Emancipation, an enemy to our ancient Constitution, sent 
            to the aforenamed Duke and Gentlemen, and under pretence that my proceeding 
            might produce disturbance, requested to know what was to be done. 
            Mr. Peel and the Duke quickly decided, and used that power placed 
            in their hands for the welfare of the State, to prevent that attack 
            upon and censure of their own conduct, which they deserved from all 
            true Protestants, and which the Duke and Mr. Peel knew they would 
            surely meet with, and they required me to be bound over to keep the 
            peace, and promise not to go to the Meeting I advertised I would attend, 
            or that I should be committed to prison*; and here an apostate Protestant 
            Lord Lieutenant joined them, writing to the Bishop against me. And 
            now forsooth they would have me be silent, and under pretext of what 
            I shall say being irrelative to the business of the meeting, put me 
            down. But I am not to be so duped and to be put down by them. No, 
            nor by all the Whigs conjointly &#8224;. And be not you, my Protestant 
            brethren. Remember, if there is any thing irrelative brought forward, 
            they have to thank themselves for it. I would have had a meeting for 
            the purpose, and they would not allow it. I must, therefore, endeavour 
            to take advantage of circumstances as I did before; nevertheless, 
            we may have perfect unanimity in petitioning for the repeal of the 
            Malt and Beer Tax, in this I am agreed with them, the repeal of such 
            taexs [<em>sic</em>] is what I proposed years ago, so that it is my 
            own motion, and they would take it out of my hands and get credit 
            with you for it; but the tax on Malt and Beer had been off years back, 
            had it not been for their covetousness, in that they regarded their 
            own welfare before yours, and if it is not now taken off it is through 
            this &#8225;. Be not therefore deluded, but petition 
            <p>for the repeal of the Malt and Beer Tax unanimously, in this the 
              poor pay 200 per cent. tax, and it ought to have been the first 
              tax taken off. But while unanimous for the repeal of this tax, be 
              equally so, my Protestant brethren, in expression of your sense 
              of the conduct of the Duke of Wellington and Mr. Peel.</p>
            <p>In the Hall I shall endeavour to mark their conduct. Remember how 
              the Duke of Wellington has dismissed two Military Officers. Also 
              how the Duke and Mr. Peel have broken in upon your Constitution 
              by their own confession. Remember how they are allying themselves 
              with Tyrants, such as Roman Catholics, Turks, Miguelites, the chief 
              of the latter, report says, they are striving to get recognized 
              against the will and wish of his Majesty. Remember to what a state 
              they have brought things. How distressing both to Manufacturers 
              and Agriculturists, and hold up both your hands against them, and 
              let your cry be, down, down with them. Let them be impeached.</p>
            <p>The Constitution of my Country I admired - I venerated. Under it 
              England prospered, liberty flourished, and Britain fought and conqured,<em> 
              </em>[<em>sic</em>] and the people were happy. The ancient Institutions 
              of my Country, such as its Protestant Universities, I venerated, 
              and do so still. They may have faults, but compared with every thing 
              like them, they are faultless.</p>
            <p>It is well known I have endeavoured to amend our University, but 
              while I do this I will uphold it and its sister with all my power, 
              and our glorious Constitution likewise, and this in spite of bastard 
              Whigs and apostate Protestants, whether Magistrates and Sheriffs, 
              or Lord Lieutenants, with even the Duke of Wellington and Mr. Peel 
              to head them. Protestants, do you join me. Is not our ancient Constitution 
              worth contending for? or shall we cowardly resign it, and idstead 
              [<em>sic</em>] of handing down what our ancestors procured with 
              their blood, shall we tacitly surrender it to a bully of a Roman 
              Catholic, because he has bullied the Duke of Wellington? I will 
              not so give it up. I will contend for it. Join me, my Protestant 
              Friends; never despair; never desist, and then we shall have back 
              what we have lost. A contest for our Constitution there must be, 
              unless we would surrender it to Roman Catholics, and now is the 
              time to have it, ere the sword is fully wrested from us and altogether 
              turned against us. Take, then, a lesson from our enemies. Behold 
              their activity and perseverance. Imitate it, and you conquer; join 
              me, persevere with me, and you do so. Protestants! come forward 
              against the Duke of Wellington and those that would deprive you 
              of your Constitution and your ancient Institutions, and defend them 
              to the last. The statesmen who would deprive us of them are our 
              enemies. Impeach them.</p>

            others, cutting jokes upon me, as is customary with a new boy, till 
            tired of their impertenance, I gave his Lordship a good box on the

            but I was freed from disturbance. I mention this because his Lordship 
            is the head of the Whigs, and he was of late Secretary of State for 
            the Home Department, whereas he was as much fit for a Minister as 
            the most timid old woman. He may screw himself up for an occasion,
