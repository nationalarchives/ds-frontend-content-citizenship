          <td > <p>Still almost daily we hear of <em>Breaking Machines</em>, and 
              <em>Burning Stacks of Corn, Barns, &amp;c. </em>Some of you are 
              led to join in these things by persons who are unknown to you; these 
              persons pretend to be your Friends; they only urge you on, they 
              would have you believe, as a means of obtaining increase of Wages 
              and Employ. Be no longer deceived, the day will come when some unexpected 
              intervention of Providence, or the activity of Man, will unmask 
              these wretches, when their dark designs will be discovered to have 
              been, to create Confusion and Disorder, in the hope of benefitting 
              <em>themselves</em> by Plunder, or by overturning the established 
              Order of Things, and you will find too late, that you have been 
              the Dupes of their designs. If they, through your means ruin the 
              Farmer, it is perfectly clear he cannot employ you, and if you are 
              apprehended for a Breach of the Law, you will be left to suffer, 
              and your leaders will have Cunning enough to keep their own Necks 
              out of the Halter. Now as you cannot be acquainted with the length 
              to which the Arm of the Law can reach you, my friendly object is 
              to open your Eyes, that you may no longer be ignorant of the risk 
              you run. Learn then, that the Law says it is a crime even if a man 
              CONCEAL what he knows in these matters, although he never consented 
              to the commission of the Crime, and that he can only save himself 
              from the consequences, by discovering the Offence to a Magistrate, 
              with all the speed he can. Further the Law says, if a Man, though 
              not present when the Crime is committed, is discovered to have procured, 
              counselled (that is advised,) commanded, or abetted, (that is encouraged, 
              or backed another to commit it,) he is an Accessory before the fact, 
              and equally liable to Punishment. So again if several Persons set 
              out together, or in small Parties, upon one common Design for any 
              Purpose in itself unlawful, and each takes his part: some to commit 
              the Crime, others to watch at proper Distances, and Stations to 
              prevent surprise, or to favor the escape of those who are more immediately 
              engaged in it, they are <em>all</em> (in the Eye of the Law) punishable 
              for it. Follow then the example of those Fellow-Labourers, who have 
              respectfully applied to their Employers for increase of Wages, where 
              they have been too low, and who have obtained Redress. There can 
              be no doubt but those Farmers who have hitherto paid you too little, 
              will now see their Error, and be induced by public Opinion, to follow 
              the Example of those Farmers who pay you what is just for your Labour. 
              Follow this advice, given by a Stranger to you, who has only your, 
              and His Country's Interest at Heart, (he is no Farmer) turn your 
              backs upon your Enemies and Deceivers, pursue your Honest Industry, 
              and become once more worthy of being respected as MEN OF KENT.</p></td>
