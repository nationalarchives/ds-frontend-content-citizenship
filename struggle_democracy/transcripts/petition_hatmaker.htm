            Hat Manufactory of Fur and Wool, was presented to the House, and read; 
            setting forth, that the Hatters in and near the City of London have 
            been for several years past, and now are, under many Difficulties 
            in carrying on their Manufactories, by reason of the great Scarcity 
            of Journeymen in the Trade, and of their repeated Demands for an advance 
            of Wages to unreasonable Prices, and to lessen their usual Hours of 
            Work; and, in order to enforce a compliance with such Demands, they 
            have entered into a Combination (which they call by the Name of a 
            Congress) and have made Bye Laws exacted Fines, and prevented divers 
            of the said Manufacturers from having or taking Apprentices, which 
            are at this Time much wanted in the said Manufactory, and is one great 
            Cause of the scarcity of Journeymen; and that the said Journeymen 
            have, by means of the above Practices compelled the most industrious 
            Part of the whole to quit the Service of those who will not submit 
            to such unwarrantable Proceedings, which the Petitioners feel with 
            great concern will be the utter Ruin of the said Manufactory, if not 
            speedily prevented; and that besides the above Practices, the Petitioners 
            are great and daily sufferers by Journeymen who embezzle their Materials, 
            and by the Buyers and Receivers of the same, the Punishment for which 
            (by the present Laws) hath been found ineffectual on account of the 
            great Difficulty in Convicting the offenders; and therefore the Petitioners 
            are without Remedy, unless they can obtain the Aid of Parliament in 
            those Cases; and that the Petitioners now pay, and are willing at 
            all Times to pay, to their Journeymen, a full and adequate Price for 
            their Labour, and such as will be sufficient to enable them comfortably 
            to support themselves and Families; but that those their Intentions 
            will be entirely frustrated, unless they are allowed to have a greater 
            number of apprentices, than the Law at present allows them; and unless 
            the wages and Prices of Work, and the Hours of working by their Journeymen, 
            by [<em>sic</em>] fixed by Authority of Parliament, or a Power invested
