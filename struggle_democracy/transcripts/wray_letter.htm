            which I am sorry to see posted up in Cambridge and seem to be permitted 
            to remain unmolested by the authorities if I had been in power I would 
            soon have ordered them down and prosecuted the author which I hope 
            to hear punished for the same he is possesed of a handsome property 
            at Chesterton one mile from Cambridge which I know very well which 
            makes him saucy but sure our Laws will not tolerate such scandal against 
            such as you and our Noble Premier who have done so much for the country 
            I hope the Malt and Beer Tax will not be thrown of if it is and the 
            Beer we shall have roiots [<em>sic</em>] I have no doubt ale only
