              May it please your Lordship <br>
              If you wish any further evidence to confirm what I have stated to 
              you respecting the Tamworth Election Bribery cases I am prepared 
              at any time your Lordship thinks fit to prove to your Lordship that 
              not only Ale but a Pig was offered for a vote for Mr Shaw the present 
              Mayor I can also prove to your Lordship that the person who offered 
              the Pig told me as a positive fact that a few days before the Election 
              he had three soverigns put in his hand to do as he thought proper 
              with to get votes for Mr Shaw and that if he wanted five or six 
              pounds more he was not to stand still but to fetch it and I can 
              also prove by a very respectable Tradesman that a lot of Men were 
              coming to vote with these papers filled up for Mr Knight which was 
              afterwards altered through the Ale Bribery in favour of Mr Shaw 
              and I can also prove to your Lordship that one person who had given 
              up his voting paper and could not get his Tickets for the Ale whent 
              [sic] back to try to get back his voting paper for that purpose, 
              Another case of a very respectable Farmer asking his Man who he 
              should vote for he said the Man that gave the most drink Another 
              of a man that was such when going to vote and on inquiry of who 
              he was voting for they found that Mr Shaw's name was not in the 
              papers the Party in favour of Mr Shaw said I will give you a quart 
              of Ale to vote for Mr Shaw the Man said no I will not vote for him 
              they then offered him two, three, and then four quarts and to prejudice 
              the man's mind said that Mr Knight the persons name he had on the 
              paper was not a Candidate for the Election I stepping up at the 
              time put a stop to the proceedings and the Man voted according to 
              his own wish and is ready to come forward to prove that this is 
              correct Many other cases similar to these I can prove from different 
              Individuals respecting the voting for the Town Councill and even 
              from Members who have been nominated for the Town Councill once 
              more begging your Lordship not to let this shamefull case pass unnoticed. 
              Waiting your Lordships reply.</p>
