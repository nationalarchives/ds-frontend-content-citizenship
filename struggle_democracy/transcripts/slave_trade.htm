            of Slaves made so by Violence? replied, He did not. He knew of public 
            Wars, but no other Instance of private Violence. Being asked, Whether 
            the Government of those Countries authorized or connived at Transactions 
            of this Sort? Captain Deane replied, They do not publicly; whether 
            or not privately he cannot say: The Plunderers would be sold themselves, 
            if discovered. Being asked, Whether the Natives of those Countries 
            go armed, in order to prevent such Outrages? he said, They generally 
            are armed, those who can afford to purchase them, with Muskets; the 
            others with Side-arms. This they do to defend themselves from Wild 
            Beasts, which are very numerous on the Windward Coast (of which only 
            Captain Deane speaks), and it may be also to protect themselves from 
            their Countrymen; but of this Captain Deane is not sure. Being asked, 
            Whether there are not a great Number of Slaves brought down from the 
            Back Country to be sold? he replied, There was a great Number; and 
            added, they make the greater Proportion of those sold. Being asked, 
            Whether the Prince of the Country has not some Duty upon, or some 
            Interest in, the Slaves that are publicly sold? Captain Deane replied, 
            He has an Emolument upon every Slave publicly sold, and generally 
            attends the Sales to receive his Duty; and for this Reason he has 
            an Interest in preventing Slaves being made so by Kidnapping and Violence. 
            Captain Deane, however, is of Opinion, that notwithstanding this, 
            the Princes of the Country sometimes privately encourage those Acts 
            of Violence.</td>
