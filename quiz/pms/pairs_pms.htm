<!--Match the Acts to the  Prime ministers Instructions There are eighteen cards. These are in nine pairs  consisting of a prime minister and an Act that was  passsed during their office. Turn over a card by  pressing on it and then turn over another card.  If they  match they will flash, if not then turn them both back  over by pressing on each of them again.  Try again to  match two cards - use your memory! If you have turned over two cards, turn them both back to face down before turning over two more cards -->
