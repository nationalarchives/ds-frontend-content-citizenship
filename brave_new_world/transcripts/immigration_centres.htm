            1. During oral evidence on 13th February, the Department undertook 
            to provide the Select Committee with further information on Immigrant 
            Centres. This paper is based on replies by H.M. Inspectors (in February) 
            to a questionnaire about the education of immigrants in the areas 
            of local education authorities in which they exceed two per cent of 
            the maintained school population, (i.e. the 47 authorities listed 
            in an appendix to the Department's previous evidence).</td>

            2. The task of all education authorities faced with an influx of immigrant 
            pupils is to enable them as quickly as possible to play a full part 
            in ordinary school life. It is necessary first to ensure that their 
            grasp of English language and customs is sufficient to enable them 
            to benefit from the school curriculum. The normal method of helping 
            pupils with severe learning handicaps is to withdraw them from classes 
            and give them separate instruction in small groups, and this is widely 
            practised with immigrants who can speak little or no English. The 
            establishment of immigrant centres is an extension of this practice 
            which brings children together either from several schools, or before 
            they enter a school, and concentrate resources and specially trained 
            or gifted teachers in one place.</td>

            3. It appears from the replies to the questionnaire that about 50 
            immigrant centres at present operate in 26 areas. In addition three 
            other authorities use remedial or adult education centres to teach 
            English to immigrant children. Thus well over half the authorities 
            with appreciable concentrations of immigrant pupils use centres as 
            a means of supplementing special instruction in the schools. </td>

            4. Five authorities use their centres to provide induction courses 
            for children before they enter school. Most, however, use them as 
            language centres, to which children may be referred after they have 
            been registered in school. A few centres appear to be used wholly 
            or partly for administrative purposes, to receive new immigrants, 
            allocate them to schools and give health checks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><br>
            5. Induction courses vary in length. In one case the period is as 
            short as a week, but is followed up where necessary by referral to 
            a language centre. The other authorities providing induction courses 
            keep the children long enough to secure reasonable fluency in English 
            and confine special language instruction afterwards to withdrawal 
            classes at school.</td>

            6. The most common practice at language centres is that children attend 
            them full-time. But one authority admits children for an hour a day, 
            another for four sessions a week and several for half-a-week. In this 
            way the children combine attendance at a centre with involvement in 
            ordinary school life. Perhaps to secure the same end, eleven language 
            centres are attached to the schools which most immigrant children 
            in the area attend. Whether attendance is part-time or full-time, 
            children will normally be retained in language centres until their 
            English is good enough for ordinary school lessons. </td>

            7. Most immigrant centres provide courses for both seniors and juniors, 
            but eight restrict courses to seniors. Another admits juniors over 
            nine. Only one authority confines attendance at centres to juniors. 
            The reason for these differences is likely to be found in the local 
            situation: the size of the centre, the availability of specialist 
            teachers to serve there, or the ability of primary and secondary schools 
            to offer facilities for withdrawal classes in terms of accommodation 
            and staffing.</td>

            8. One unusual arrangement should be mentioned. This is to use the 
            language centre exclusively to train teachers and to store specialist 
            books and equipment. All special teaching of immigrant pupils in this 
            area is carried out in withdrawal classes.</td>

            9. In the second phase of the urban programme nine authorities have 
            so far submitted proposals relating to immigrant centres. Two are 
            seeking assistance towards the running costs of centres already built 
            and five wish to extend existing centres. Two authorities are proposing 
            to build their first centre. The trend towards this type of provision 
            seems likely, therefore, to be maintained.</td>
