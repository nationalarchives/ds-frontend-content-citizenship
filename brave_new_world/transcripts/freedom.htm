            In all other fields British provision for security, in adequacy of 
            amount and in comprehensiveness, will stand comparison with that of 
            any other country; few countries will stand comparison with Britain. 
            Second, social insurance and the allied services, as they exist today, 
            are conducted by a complex of disconnected administrative organs, 
            proceeding on different principles, doing invaluable service but at 
            a cost in money and trouble and anomalous treatment of identical problems 
            for which there is no justification. In a system of social security 
            better on the whole than can be found in almost any other country 
            there are serious deficiencies which call for remedy.</td>

            contract of service and below a certain remuneration if engaged on 
            non-manual work is a serious gap. Many persons working on their own 
            account are poorer and more in need of State insurance than employees; 
            the remuneration limit for non-manual employees is arbitrary and takes 
            no account of family responsibility. There is, again, no real difference 
            between the income needs of persons who are sick and those who are 
            unemployed, but they get different rates of benefit involving different 
            contribution conditions and with meaningless distinctions between 
            persons of different ages. An adult insured man with a wife and two 
            children receives 38/- per week should he become unemployed; if after 
            some weeks of unemployment he becomes sick and not available for work, 
            his insurance income falls to 18/-. On the other hand a youth of 17 
            obtains 9/- when he is unemployed, but should he become sick his insurance 
            income rises to 12/- per week. There are, to take another example, 
            three different means tests for non-contributory pensions, for supplementary 
            pensions and for public assistance, with a fourth test - for unemployment 
            assistance - differing from that for supplementary pensions in some

          <td>The work of the Inter-departmental Committee began with a review 
            of existing schemes of social insurance and allied services. The Plan 
            for Social Security, with which that work ends, starts from a diagnosis 
            of want - of the circumstances in which, in the years just preceding 
            the present war, families and individuals in Britain might lack the 
            means of healthy subsistence. During those years impartial scientific 
            authorities made social surveys of the conditions of life in a number 
            of principal towns in Britain, including London, Liverpool, Sheffield, 
            Plymouth, Southampton, York and Bristol. They determined the proportions 
            of the people in each town whose means were below the standard assumed 
            to be necessary for subsistence, and they analysed the extent and 
            causes of that deficiency. From each of these social surveys the same 
            broad result emerges. Of all the want shown by the surveys, from three-quarters 
            to five-sixths, according to the precise standard chosen for want, 
            was due to interruption or loss of earning power. Practically the 
            whole of the remaining one-quarter to one-sixth was due to failure 
            to relate income during earning to the size of the family. These surveys 
            were made before the introduction of supplementary pensions had reduced 
            amount of poverty amongst old persons. But this does not affect the 
            main conclusion to be drawn from these surveys: abolition of want 
            requires a double re-distribution of income, through social insurance 
            and by family needs.</td>

          <td>Abolition of want requires, first, improvement of State insurance, 
            that is to say provision against interruption and loss of earning 
            power. All the principal causes of interruption or loss of earnings 
            are now the subject of schemes of social insurance. If, in spite of 
            these schemes, so many persons unemployed or sick or old or widowed 
            are found to be without adequate income for subsistence according 
            to the standards adopted in the social surveys, this means that the 
            benefits amount to less than subsistence by those standards or do 
            not last as long as the need, and that the assistance which supplements 
            insurance is either insufficient in amount or available only on terms 
            which make men unwilling to have recourse to it. None of the insurance 
            benefits provided before the war were in fact designed with reference 
            to the standards of the social surveys. Though unemployment benefit 
            was not altogether out of relation to those standards, sickness and 
            disablement benefit, old age pensions and widows' pensions were far 
            below them, while workmen's compensation was below subsistence level 
            for anyone who had family responsibilities or whose earning in work 
            were less than twice the amount needed for subsistence. To prevent 
            interruption or destruction of earning power from leading to want, 
            it is necessary to improve the present schemes of social insurance 
            in three directions: by extension of scope to cover persons now excluded, 
            by extension of purposes to cover risks now excluded, and by raising 
            the rates of benefit.</td>
