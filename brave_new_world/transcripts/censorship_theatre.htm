            a matter of fact most people, if they think about it at all, have

            distinction, between the Lord Chamberlain in his theatrical capacity 
            and the Lord Chamberlain in his Court functions. And after all whoever

              we always think of ourselves as a licensing authority rather than 
              as a censoring authority. The bias is always to give a licence unless 
              there is very strong ground for objection. My personal objective 
              is to try to assess the norm of educated adult opinion and if possible 
              to keep just a touch ahead of it.</p>
            <p>I find I have to make a positive effort to keep my own personal 
              tastes, likes and dislikes right out of the picture. They are obviously 
              irrelevant for censorship purposes. Of course, one must make some 
              allowance for selectivity; people don't have to go to the theatre; 
              they choose what they want to see and if they want to they can quite 
              easily find out something about the play before they go.</p></td>

            on. For proof of that one only need to listen to the reaction when 
            television oversteps the mark a bit. The question is where should 
            the line be drawn; on which, obviously, everyone has his own ideas.</td>

            is a pre-censorship of various kinds; there is a board of film censors 
            and B.B.C. and I.T.A. themselves all have responsibilities in their 
            own fields. The media are of course different and different considerations 
            apply in each case. But in each one somebody is concerned to draw 
            a line. I would agree that the whole question of censorship has entered 
            a new phase with the growth of drama on radio and on television. It 
            might well be that in due course it would be a good thing to have 
            a comprehensive new look at censorship in all these media. But I feel 
            myself that that might perhaps be more productive in a few years' 
            time, when there has been longer experience on the television side. 
            Literature, of course, is another problem. I doubt whether people 
            feel too happy about the present arrangements in that field, but I 
            don't think that comes into our discussion.</td>
