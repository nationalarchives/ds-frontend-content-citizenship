            town.<br>
            </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you notice people calling 
            to each other in the streets - in Italian. Or an olive-skinned housewife 
            gesticulating at a market stall. Or dark eyes twinkling under black 
            berets on the bus.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One in 12 of 
            Bedford's 60,000 people is Italian. They are lured by the rich employment 
            of sprawling brickworks that lie a mile or so beyond Bedford's boundaries.<br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1951 they have been moving in 
            with their wives, children - and momma and poppa, too.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now 
            the town council has called a halt. No more Italians can find a home 
            in the terraced streets where the Giovannis and Emmanuels have replaced 
            the Joneses and the Smiths.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a 
            unanimous vote the Conservative council has refused an application 
            by the Marston Valley Brick Co. for permission to employ 200 more 
            Italians. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manager Robert Miller 
            said: &quot;They are first-class workers. We simply can't get Englishmen 
            to work in the brickfields. It's a difficult and hard job. And the 
            Italians do it well.&quot;</td>

            do the foreigners differ from the English people of Bedford? To get 
            an idea, see how they prepare for an Italian-style New Year. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Commercial-road's flavour-laden delicatessen, 
            31-year-old Nicola Vittorio mopped his brow amid the heaps of cheeses, 
            the wicker-encased Chianti bottles and the stacked cases of spaghetti. 
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: &quot;We may be 2,000 
            miles from home - but our people are going to have an Italian New 
            Year.&quot;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enthusiastically he 
            told me of the Italian fare: &quot;Already for Christmas we have had 
            our traditional eels, our roast cockerel and our very special spaghetti. 
            Now we prepare for the New Year.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Every 
            family will have a gallon flagon of Chianti on their table - triumphant 
            amid the nougat, the Motta cake and the cheeses.&quot;</td>

            rehearsed a play under the eyes of Italian Sister Andrina Bosetti. 
            They joked to one another in startling Bedfordshire accents. Then 
            - hesitantly - spoke the Italian lines of their play.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
            a temporary chapel, Italian Father Alberto Vico studied plans for 
            a new all-Italian church. He is one of three Italian priests in the 
            town.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday there will be sermons in English 
            and Italian in the English Holy Jesus church.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But 
            soon we will have our own church,&quot; said the priest.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
            a gay Italian club men sipped Chianti and played cards.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who helped to close the door 
            to more Italians explained his town's problem. Mayor Alderman Alan 
            Randall told me:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I 
            am proud of Bedford. And Bedford is proud of its Italians. They have 
            made a valuable contribution to the welfare and prosperity of our 
            town.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But there are complex 
            problems. They pack into houses like sardines. Our Public Health Department 
            has had to be augmented to cope with the problem. And we still have 
            1,100 on our housing list.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In 
            our schools the language problem is acute. English children are being 
            held back.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our maternity wards 
            are overflowing with foreign mums and many an English girl has to 
            have her first baby at home.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There is no malice or bias in 
            our refusal to let more Italians join their friends here. Five thousand 
            Italians are part of our town - it's for their good, too, that we 
            cannot allow services to be overstrained and collapse.&quot;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Bedford 
            Italian Vice-Consul, Dr. Mario Capobinco:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We 
            don't hold any grudge against the council. They have given us every 
            help. We have to thank Bedford's townsfolk for giving us a welcome 
            and a home.&quot;</td>
