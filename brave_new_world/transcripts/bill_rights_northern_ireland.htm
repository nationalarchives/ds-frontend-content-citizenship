            The 1920 Act, which originally was designed to apply both north and 
            south of the Border, contains provisions which make it unconstitutional 
            for Parliament to enact laws of a discriminatory kind and equally 
            prohibit the Government in its executive decisions from any such action.

            to our way of thinking. No one Westminster law sets out to confer 
            civil rights on the people; they exist and are confirmed as may be 
            necessary in statute law, decisions of the Courts, common law, custom 
            and convention. And this will be increasingly true in Northern Ireland. 
            On the other hand the minority compare themselves with coloured people 
            in this country and they point to the necessity here for our Race 
            Relations legislation and ask for its extension to religion and its 
            application to Northern Ireland.</td>

            current developments in Northern Ireland. All have been taken aboard 
            in one way or another and unless progress is seriously impeded by 
            untoward political developments in the Province it should not be too 
            long before the claim can be made that demands incorporated in the 
            proposed Bill of Rights have been substantially met in other ways. 
            The minority has, naturally, to be convinced of this; Cardinal Conway's 
            recent assessment of the Roman Catholic minority was heartening in 
            that it seemed that they were beginning to appreciate what was afoot. 
            The post-Easter violence and the election of Protestant Unionists 
            may have upset this.</td>
