            1. Entry into the European Communities would not of course affect 
            the position of the Monarchy, nor would it in itself have any effect 
            upon the constitutional position of the Crown in Parliament. There 
            are 5 other monarchs among the members and applicants. There is no 
            question of any of these giving up their sovereignty, nor of there 
            being a Community head of state or even a Community State to be head 
            of. The Community will be a Community of sovereign states. </td>

            2. The United Kingdom would continue to be a sovereign independent 
            state just as present members of the European Community are. We would 
            for example continue to participate in international organisations 
            such as the United Nations, whose membership is open to sovereign 
            states. By entering the Community the United Kingdom would be undertaking 
            certain international obligations in the fields covered by the European 
            Treaties. Like obligations in other Treaties which are binding upon 
            the United Kingdom, these obligations would affect the United Kingdom's 
            freedom of action, but only in the fields covered by the Treaties. 
            These fields are limited to certain economic and commercial affairs 
            and closely related matters; they do not include defence.</td>

            3. Some of the United Kindom's existing Treaties in economic and commercial 
            matters would be inconsistent with obligations under the European 
            Treaties. We therefore intend <span class="strikethru"> with the agreement 
            of the other parties concerned</span> to secure the termination of 
            these agreements in so far as they conflict with our European Community 
            obligations. Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome takes account of this 
            situation. Outside the limited fields covered by the Community Treaties, 
            our freedom to conclude Treaties with other states would not be affected 
            by membership.</td>

            4. While it is true that the EEC and Euratom Treaties are concluded 
            for an unlimited period and the ECSC Treaty for 50 years, in the last 
            analysis (as the White Paper makes clear) the Community system rests 
            on the original consent and on the continuing consent of member states 
            and therefore of national Governments. Nothing in the Treaties requires 
            the member states to change the procedures of their legislative bodies. 
            Parliament will continue to exercise control over the actions of their 
            Ministers and Ministers will be answerable to Parliament for the part 
            they and their officials play in the formation of Government policy. 
            In legislating Parliament would of course have to take account of 
            Community obligations and refrain from enacting legislation contrary 
            to these obligations, just as we already do in connection with other 
            Treaties.</td>

            5. By far the greater part of our domestic law would be unaffected. 
            Only certain provisions of Community law primarily regulations made 
            by the Council and the Commission apply directly as law in each member 
            state.</td>

            6. In the Community all major decisions are taken by the Council of 
            Ministers, on which we should be represented. Although the European 
            Treaties provide for majority voting on most matters, the member states 
            recognise that it is not in practice possible to force another member 
            state to act contrary to its vital national interests. As the Prime 
            Minister said in the House of Commons after his meeting with President 
            Pompidou......&quot;The maintenance and strengthening of the fabric 
            of co-operation in the Community requires that decisions should in 
            practice be taken by unanimous agreement when vital national interests 
            of any one or more members are at stake&quot;.</td>
