            local Government Departments, or which voluntary organisations they 
            should apply in their particular difficulty. Although it is important

            A.R.P., or the preliminary evacuation scheme, it is expected that

            value as centres to which they can refer cases of difficulty needing 
            advice or help from voluntary sources. While, therefore, the Bureaux
