              vote. I was not committed to this at the last general election, 
              nor were hundreds of other candidates, and I consider the indiscriminate 
              increase of the franchise, without a shred of responsibility, to 
              be the most idiotic and ill-considered piece of legislation that 
              has ever been proposed. - <em>Captain J.W. Reynolds, in a letter 
              to the Doncaster Conservative Executive, on his resigning his candidature 
              for the Don Valley Division.<br>
              </em><br>
              In his letter to the Doncaster Conservative Executive Captain Reynolds 
              expresses what there is every reason to believe are the real sentiments 
              of the great majority of Conservative voters. They have never been 
              asked their opinion on the Government's crazy project of giving 
              votes to girls of 21; and the more they hear of it the more they 
              dislike it.<br>
              <br>
              The best judges almost without exception are convinced that &quot;votes 
              for 'flappers'&quot; means &quot;votes for Socialists,&quot; with 
              deadly results to the Conservative Party. Every one knows that no 
              pledge to enfranchise &quot;flappers&quot; was given by the Government 
              at the last general election.<br>
              <br>
              The municipal elections, in which the Socialists have secured huge 
              gains, mainly at the cost of the Conservatives, supply fresh evidence 
              that the character of the electorate has not yet recovered from 
              the last great inflation of 1918. There is clearly an enormous mass 
              of voters who, no doubt, are well-meaning enough but have not acquired 
              the sense of responsibility and that political </p></td>
          <td valign="top">instinct without which representative institutions 
            cannot work. These irresponsible voters sway this way and that and 
            are always liable to vote for those who will promise them most at 
            other people's expense.<br> <br>
            When such is the electoral situation, to add another 4 1/2 million 
            votes to the undigested millions already on the register is to complicate 
            all the problems of government and to play the Socialist game-a procedure 
            of which certain of the Conservative leaders seem so enamoured that 
            they have recourse to it at every turn. Yet, as Lord Rothermere has 
            warned them, &quot;you cannot fight Socialism with Socialism.&quot; 
            <br> <br>
            If votes are given to &quot;flappers&quot; and if the constituencies 
            are flooded with new and inexperienced voters, men will be placed 
            in a minority in two-thirds of the constituencies; and the Socialist 
            vote will be so largely increased that a Socialist Government will 
            become inevitable. It is an open secret that Socialists calculate 
            that <em>at least three-fourths of the new votes will be given to 
            them, thus enabling them to sweep the country.<br>
            <br>
            </em>The first fruits of the present Conservative policy of trying 
            to outbid the Socialists with Socialistic measures are now being reaped 
            by the Conservative Party in the municipal elections. The full harvest 
            of this policy will come with the next general election of members 
            for the House of Commons. With the help of the &quot;flappers'&quot; 
            vote the Socialists believe that the total of Conservatives in the 
            next Parliament will be reduced to such a small remnant as to paralyse 
            the Conservative Party and deprive it for an indefinite period of 
            all effective political influence. </td>
