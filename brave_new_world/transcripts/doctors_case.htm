            some 200 years ago, judges were paid by the State and were thus under 
            the complete control of the State. As a result they were not trusted. 
            Their judgments in court were always being influenced by the wishes 
            of the State - their paymasters. Judges were corrupt and tended to 
            give decisions in court cases according to what the Government of 
            the day wanted. The country got so tired of the misery and uncertainty 
            caused by this untrustworthiness that it was decided that our judges 
            should be taken out of direct control by the State.* For the last 
            two centuries, accordingly, it has not been possible to dismiss a 
            judge except by Resolution of both Houses of Parliament, and judges' 
            salaries are not paid either by the Cabinet or Parliament. Their salaries 
            are paid direct from the Consolidated Fund. In other words, great 
            care was taken to see that judges should be above financial or other 
            pressure.</td>

            think of what the Government wants, which may not be what the individual
