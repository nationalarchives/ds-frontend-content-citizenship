          <td>1. The United Kingdom, as befits the founder and leading member 
            of a multi-racial Commonwealth of Nations, is itself a multi-racial 
            and multi-national society. It comprises four distinguishable ethnic 
            groups - English, Welsh, Scots and Irish - each with its own historical 
            traditions and surviving customs, language, culture, even dress. Claims 
            to unique indigenous origins have been largely obscured during the 
            long process of integration but ethnic consciousness and the distinctive 
            symbols of nationality are still cherished. Into this long-established 
            plurality of peoples, national from many other countries have poured 
            from time to time, encouraged by a liberal immigration tradition and 
            driven on by outside pressures. In the Middle Ages Flemish weaver 
            and [<em>handwritten</em>], later, the Huguenots each formed a notable 
            influx, mere decades ago refugees from Nazi persecution came in large 
            numbers to settle. Over the centuries such tides of immigration have 
            been large and not infrequent. Above all they have been highly beneficial 
            to the British community and accepted as such in both the cultural 
            and economic fields by expanding and stimulating the commonwealth 
            of skill and creative talent.</td>

            The sources and status of human rights</span> </strong></td>

        <tr> 
          <td>2. The history of the United Kingdom contains few recorded attempts 
            to extirpate the distinctive identity of any of the four major ethnic 
            groups. For this reason amongst others perhaps, the acknowledgement 
            of human rights has not been based on the defence, or definition, 
            of the rights of subject minorities, but has broadly developed in 
            the spirit of the general British attitude to the law. Human rights 
            in United Kingdom are not based on any fundamental laws specially 
            entrenched, like the constitutions of some countries, against the 
            normal processes of repeal and amendment, nor is the constitution 
            enshrined in a single document. The general body of law is an amalgam 
            of common and statute law and of convention, to be found in a variety 
            of sources and authorities. This code, like the system of government 
            itself, is highly flexible. It can be readily adapted to contemporary 
            public opinion, and to new political, economic and social conditions 
            as and when they arise.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <table width="100%" border="0">
        <tr> 
          <td>3. This flexibility has engendered confidence in the system of government 
            and in the procedure by which laws are framed and passed, and this 
            in turn has increased respect for the law. In such a climate, enlightened 
            public opinion has been free to show that failure to respect human 
            rights would be contrary to public interest and against the public 
            will. The British people have thus developed an instinctive respect 
            for the individual side by side with respect for the law; they have 
            a tender conscience on the subject of minorities and a tradition of 
            sympathy towards the under-privileged; and they are willing to extend 
            to their fellow men those liberties and freedoms without which they 
            feel that existence would be of small account. The principles derived 
            from this conception of human values have been woven into the British 
            constitution and national way of life. Thus, in law, every individual 
            in the United Kingdom whatever his race, colour, sex, religion, political 
            or other opinion, or national or social origin, has a right to his 
            personal liberty; to access to the courts and the legal remedies available 
            there; to assembly and association for lawful purposes; to practise 
            and propagate his religion; and to reside or move where he will. The 
            British people feel strongly, however, that the vitality of civil 
            liberty is not to be measured only in terms of constitutional guarantees, 
            or court decisions enforcing them; it depends in the last analysis 
            upon the degree to which the public opinion of the nation values civil 
            liberty and demands its effective protection.</td>
