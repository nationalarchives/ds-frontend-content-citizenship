            On the occasion of his visit to the lecture room of the National Insurance 
            Committee, at Millbank House, Westminster, yesterday morning, the

            the purpose of explaining the Act to the people of this country, and 
            I congratulate the Committee on the methods they have adopted. There 
            is no doubt that there is a vast amount of misapprehension as to the 
            character of the Act. I am amazed at the blunders that people have 
            made about the Act - and fairly intelligent people, too. They may, 
            or may not, be intentional, of course, except in some cases (laughter). 
            I like to take a charitable view of human nature, but they are really 
            very extraordinary mistakes.</td>

            they are bound to be amazed and, in the second place, that they are 
            very indignant. You have a gigantic task</td>

            is accomplished, you will find that there will be such a feeling in 
            favour of working the Act and in favour of its provisions generally 
            that it will be a source of enormous strength to the general Liberal 
            policy (hear, hear). In fact, I think that the success of Liberalism, 
            not merely in this, but also in other measures, will very largely 
            depend upon the atmosphere which you create by the success of your 
            lectures.</td>

            I wish you will in your task. You are rendering an enormous service, 
            not merely to Liberalism, but, I think, to humanity. Had I not believed 
            that this Act of Parliament was going to relieve a large amount of 
            undeserved suffering, I would not have touched it (hear, hear). I 
            felt that it was worth incurring all the trouble and all the labour, 
            worth facing all the misrepresentations and all the malignant abuse, 
            for the purpose of putting it through, and when, at the end of a few 
            years, you and I will realise the amount of distress that we have 
            saved we shall be able, at any rate, to share in the satisfaction 
            which will be deep and permanent in your lives and in mine (loud cheers).</td>
