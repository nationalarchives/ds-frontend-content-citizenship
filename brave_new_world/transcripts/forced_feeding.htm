            I beg to acquaint the Serj[ean]t at Arms that at 5.45 pm 25th Isabella 
            Irvine (apparently a Suffragette) of 13 Victoria Road Brighton entered 
            St Stephens Hall and enquired for Sir Frederick Banbury M.P she was 
            accompanied by 2 other women, PC 191a Cooper gave her a card (attached) 
            which she handed back to him the other two then engaged him, Irvine 
            was carrying a cloak over her arm and passed behind him going up the 
            steps she pulled out a new hammer and smashed the right side of window 
            leading to Central Hall, exclaiming that it was a protest against 
            forcible feeding, and the imprisonment of Emily Davison, she was taken 
            into custody charged at Cannon Row Police Station by Mr P E Ridge 
            Clerk of Works with wilful damage to the value of 20/- from enquiry 
            she appears to have been charged previously outside, I am of opinion 
            that it is an isolated act and not done with the knowledge of the 
            Womens Social and Political Union to which body she says she belongs 
            to, as there were several in the Hall at the time, they although they 
            knew her seemed surprised at her action Mrs Despard of the Womens 
            Freedom League was a witness and repudiated her action.<br> <br>
            She will appear at Bow Street 10 am 26th.<br> </td>
