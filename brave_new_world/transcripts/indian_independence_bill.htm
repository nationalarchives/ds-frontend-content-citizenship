            <p align="center"> <strong>INDIAN INDEPENDENCE BILL<br>
              </strong>Order for Second Reading read. </p>
            <p>3.51 p.m.<strong><br>
              The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee):</strong> I have it in Command from 
              His Majesty to acquaint the House that he places his Prerogative 
              and interests, so far as concerns the matters dealt with by the 
              Bill, at the disposal of Parliament.<br>
              <br>
              I beg to move, &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              I am afraid I shall have to ask the indulgence of the House for 
              taking up more of its time than is my custom, but the theme is a 
              great one. There will also be passages which I am afraid I shall 
              have to read, as verbal accuracy in dealing with some high matters 
              is important. This Bill brings to an end one chapter in the long 
              connection between Britain and India, but it opens another. British 
              rule which has endured so long is now, at the instance of this country, 
              coming to an end.<br>
              <br>
              There have been many instances in history when States at the point 
              of the sword have been forced to surrender government over another 
              people. It is very rare for a people that have long enjoyed power 
              over another nation to surrender it voluntarily. My mind recalls 
              as the nearest parallel the action of the Liberal Government of 
              Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, in 1906, when he gave back to the 
              Dutch in South Africa the freedom to manage their own affairs which 
              they had lost in the South African war. That was a great act of 
              faith, an act of faith which bore fruit both in 1914 and 1939. I 
              have often heard that great South African statesman, General Smuts, 
              describing it as marking the end of imperialism. I regret, and I 
              am sure the House will regret, that the statesman, who was then 
              a young Under-Secretary, who had the honour of announcing the decision 
              of the Government to extend responsible government to the Transvaal 
              41 years ago - the right hon. Gentleman the leader of the Opposition 
              - is not, for reasons which we all know, able to be present at our 
              Debate today.<br>
              <br>
              One would be tempted to speak at length on the history of the British 
              in </p></td>
          <td width="50%" valign="top"><br>
            India, but that would take up far too much time. I would only allude 
            to a few points. The history of our connection in India begins with 
            our trading ventures, the story of the East India Company. It goes 
            on with the contest with the French for the mastery of the peninsula, 
            the gradual extension of British power, partly by conquest but still 
            more by voluntary cession of authority to the British by those who 
            sought, under our aegis, the peace and security often denied to them 
            during the anarchic period that followed the breakdown of the Mogul 
            Empire.<br> <br>
            We can recall how, 90 years ago, the Government of the East India 
            Company came to an end when Parliament assumed responsibility for 
            Indian affairs. During those long years there has been a change in 
            the spirit of British administration. In the earlier days we were 
            concerned mainly with trade providing opportunities for making fortunes. 
            In the eighteenth century British citizens returning from India had 
            often made fortunes and were known as nabobs. But, as time went on, 
            there was an increasing appreciation of the responsibility which fell 
            to the government of the East India Company, a responsibility for 
            the lives of many millions who sought justice and a quiet life. The 
            British administrator in India became more and more deeply concerned 
            with the well-being of the people of India, the well-being of that 
            great congeries of people divided by race, by caste, language and 
            religion in this sub-continent.<br> <br>
            To this change of spirit the House of Commons, in many famous Debates 
            from the time of Burke onwards, made a most notable contribution. 
            Perhaps it is not always realised how early that change took place. 
            It was long before the transfer of sovereignty to the Crown. In the 
            early days of the nineteenth century, great men, such as Sir Thomas 
            Munro in Madras, set the standards which have since been followed 
            by so many who have served India. Looking back today over the years, 
            we may well be proud of the work which our fellow citizens have done 
            in India. There have, of course, been mistakes, there have been failures, 
            but we can assert that our rule in India will stand comparison with 
            that of any other nation which has been charged with the ruling of 
            a people so different from themselves.There has been a great succession

              I think not least among them would be accounted the present Viceroy. 
              There is a roll of names of eminent Governors of Provinces, high 
              among which is that of the right hon. Gentleman The Member for Scottish 
              Universities (Sir J. Anderson). There has been a multitude of administrators, 
              soldiers, missionaries and others who have served India with great 
              devotion and have loved the Indian people. In every part of India 
              are the graves of those who died in her service. Not least among 
              those who have served India are the men who in the difficult and 
              exacting times of the last four decades, under the stress of two 
              great wars with all their repercussions on Indian life, have worked 
              in the changing conditions that have resulted from the rise of Indian 
              nationalism and the development of self-government. </p>
            <p>May I recall here a thing that is not always remembered, that just 
              as India owes her unity and freedom from external aggression to 
              the British, so the Indian National Congress itself was founded 
              and inspired by men of our own race, and further, that any judgment 
              passed on our rule in India by Indians is passed on the basis, not 
              of what obtained in the past in India, but on the principles which 
              we have ourselves instilled into them. I am well aware that many 
              of those who have been closely associated with India are anxious 
              about the future of the millions for whom we are now relinquishing 
              responsibility. I can understand their anxiety. They fear that the 
              work to which they have devoted themselves for so many years may 
              be brought to nought. They are anxious for those who would suffer 
              most from a breakdown of administration - the poorest sections of 
              the community. </p>
            <p>We must all be anxious, but I think everybody realises that the 
              service of Britain to India must now take another form. The constitutional 
              change, vital as it is, does not, of course, mean the disappearance 
              of the civilian European community in India. Not a few of those 
              of the British race who have been in the Services in India will, 
              we confidently expect, be willing, at the invitation of the two 
              new Governments, to continue in official service in India and Pakistan. 
              The business community in India has still, I am confident, a role 
              to play in main-</p></td>
          <td valign="top"><p>taining, between the populations in India and this 
              country, trade and commerce, to the great benefit of both. To all 
              those men and women, who, although domiciled in the United Kingdom, 
              are intending to remain in India after Pakistan, I would say: &quot;You 
              have a great task in front of you, namely, to cement the bonds of 
              friendship between this country, India and Pakistan. You can accomplish 
              as least as much in achieving this end as can the British Government.&quot;</p>
            Many years ago, when we began the association of Indians in the responsibility 
            of Government and set ourselves to train them in the methods of democracy, 
            it was obvious that the time would come, sooner or later, when Indians 
            would seek to secure the entire management of their own affairs. This 
            was clear many years ago to some of our wisest administrators, and 
            I quote from a letter of Mountstuart Elphinstone as long ago as 1854:<br> 
            <em>&quot;The moral is that we must not dream of perpetual possession, 
            but must apply ourselves to bring the natives into a state that will 
            admit of their governing themselves in a a manner that may be beneficial 
            to our interests as well as their own, and that of the rest of the 
            world; and to take the glory of the achievement and the sense of having 
            done our duty for the chief reward of our exertions.&quot;</em><br>
            It has been the settled policy of all parties in this country for 
            many years that Indians, in course of time, should manage their own 
            affairs. The question has always been how and when? It would, I think, 
            be unprofitable today to go back into the past and to question whether, 
            if some particular action had been taken by a British Government earlier, 
            or if a different line of conduct had been taken by the Indian political 
            leaders on certain occasions, a more satisfactory solution might have 
            been found than that which I am commending to the House today. 
            <p>There are hon. Members of this House, such as the noble Lord the 
              Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton) and the hon. Member for Aylesbury 
              (Sir S. Reed), whose connection with the Indian problem goes back 
              far beyond mine. Some 20 years ago, I was first brought into contact 
              with it by being placed on the Simon Commission, and I think they 
              would agree with me that the major difficulty that has faced all 
              of us in considering the best way of achieving</p></td>

        <tr> 
          <td width="50%" valign="top">Indian self-government has been the absence 
            of mutual trust and toleration between the communities. It has sometimes 
            been said by our enemies that this was a difficulty created by ourselves 
            in order to perpetuate our own rule. Nothing could be more untrue. 
            This same difficulty, which faced Mr. Edwin Montagu and the Simon 
            Commission, faced the President of the Board of Trade in his Mission 
            and my three Cabinet colleagues in theirs, and it was still the outstanding 
            difficulty of the present Viceroy when he took office. Everyone who 
            has touched the Indian problem has been brought up against this stumbling-block. 
            They have all wanted to maintain the unity of India, to give India 
            complete self-government and to preserve the rights of minorities. 
            Every one of them has hoped that a solution might be found without 
            resorting to partition. I know that many Indians of all communities 
            passionately desire this, but it has not been found to be practicable.<br> 
            <br>
            We and the Indian statesmen have had to accept the only alternative 
            - partition. For myself, I earnestly hope that this severance may 
            not endure, and that the two new Dominions which we now propose to 
            set up may, in course of time, come together again to form one great 
            member State of the British Commonwealth of Nations. But this is entirely 
            a matter for the Indians themselves. The demand for self-government 
            has been insistently pressed for many years by the leaders of political 
            thought in India, and has been stimulated by the external situation, 
            and particularly by those great waves of nationalist feeling that 
            accompanied both the great wars. This demand is not peculiar to India, 
            but has spread throughout Asia. It is the natural result of contact 
            by dwellers in other continents with European political thought. The 
            chief question has been as to how this desire could be gratified. 
            Delay in granting it has always led to more and more extreme demands.<br> 
            <br>
            There has been a tendency to consider that nothing short of complete 
            and absolute severance would satisfy this urge. There is a desire 
            by some to cut every tie which connects them with their former rulers. 
            On the other hand, in the age in which we live, there are very strong 
            reasons which militate against the complete isolation which some demand. 
            Many</td>
          <td width="50%" valign="top">countries that long enjoyed their freedom 
            and independence have lost it either permanently or temporarily, and 
            some form of association with others for security and greater prosperity 
            is the desire of many peoples. The League of Nations and the United 
            Nations organisation express this desire, but the one great practical 
            example of how complete freedom and independence can be combined with 
            inclusion in a greater whole is the British Commonwealth of Nations.<br> 
            <br>
            The British Commonwealth of Nations is so unique that its nature is 
            still not fully comprehended, and even many of our American friends 
            do not understand that the Dominions are as free as Great Britain. 
            They do not appreciate that membership of the British Commonwealth, 
            in the words of the Prime Minister of New Zealand is, &quot;independence 
            with something added, not independence with something taken away.&quot; 
            In this Bill, we set up two independent Dominions, free and equal, 
            of no less status than the United Kingdom or the Dominion of Canada, 
            completely free in all respects from any control by this country, 
            but united by a common allegiance to the Sovereign and by a community 
            of ideas, receiving from their membership of the Commonwealth great 
            advantages, but in no way suffering any restriction. The Title of 
            this Bill expresses this fact that the independence which has been 
            the goal for so long of many Indians can be, and I believe will be 
            realised within the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is my hope 
            that these two new Dominions may continue in this great association, 
            giving and receiving benefits.<br> <br>
            I saw with great regret in one paper, and I think in one paper only, 
            that the action which we are now taking was described as abdication. 
            It is not abdication, but the fulfilment of Britain's mission in India. 
            It is the culminating point in a long course of events. The Morley-Minto 
            proposals, the Montagu-Chelmsford proposals, the Simon Commission 
            Report, the Round Table Conferences, the Act of 1935, the Declaration 
            at the time of the Cripps Mission, the visit of my right hon. Friends 
            to India last year, are all steps in the road that led up eventually 
            to the proposals that I announced to the House on 3rd June last. This 
            Bill is designed to implement those proposals, which met, I think, 
            with general acceptance in this House and in the country.</td>
