          <td> <p>Prince Charles Edward Stuart - grandson of the Catholic king 
              James II, who had abandoned the throne and fled England in 1688 
              - landed in the Outer Hebrides in the summer of 1745. His intention 
              was to lead a <a href="../../glossary.htm#jacobitism" target="_blank">Jacobite<img src="../../graphics/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens new window" width="6" height="15" border="0"></a> 
              rebellion in Scotland that would attract French support for an invasion 
              of England and pave the way for the overthrow of George II (referred 
              to here as the Elector of Hanover). <br>
              <br>
              The optimism of Bonnie Price Charlie's scheme is illustrated by 
              his proclamation. Initially he met with success: his forces took 
              Edinburgh, defeated government forces at Prestonpans, and were able 
              to move south to Derby. But ultimately his ambitions proved to have 
              been hopelessly idealistic. Following a retreat to Scotland, he 
              was defeated by the Duke of Cumberland at Culloden in April 1746 
              and Jacobitism was extinct as a political force. <br>
