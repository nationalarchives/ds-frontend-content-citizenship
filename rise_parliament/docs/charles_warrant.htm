            <p>On 6 January 1649 (New Style calendar, 1648 Old Style) the House 
              of Commons passed an 'Act' appointing 135 commissioners to be a 
              High Court of Justice to try King Charles I. In spite of many defections 
              and of doubts about procedure, the court met formally for the first 
              time on January 20th in Westminster Hall and by the 26th, after 
              hearing depositions from 33 witnesses, the commissioners had agreed 
              amongst themselves to condemn the king to death. On Saturday 27th 
              their sentence was pronounced in open court. <br>
              By then the death warrant had already been drawn up, with blanks 
              for the time and place of the execution, which a committee was left 
              to arrange. Some signatures - perhaps the first 28 - may well have 
              been collected at that stage. Nothing could be done on the Sunday 
              but, once the details of the execution had been approved on Monday 
              29th, the blanks were filled in and the warrant was taken into the 
              Painted Chamber where the remaining signatures were added. Ultimately, 
              59 of the 67 commissioners who had pronounced judgement signed the 
              warrant. <br>
              <br>
              The story that Cromwell had to browbeat some of the commissioners 
              into signing is unproven, but certainly there had been a delay in 
              settling arrangements which the warrant had not allowed for. It 
              therefore became necessary to erase the dates and replace them with 
              'xxixth' January and 'uppon Saturday last'. Presumably also two 
              of the original army officers to whom the warrant was addressed 
              had refused to serve and the names of Hacker and Phayre were substituted. 
              Other alterations may represent corrections to scribal errors though 
              it is not clear whether Gregory Clement wrote his name over an erasure 
              or whether his name was (incompletely) erased in 1652 because of 
              his scandalous behaviour. <br>
              <br>
              On January 30th Charles I went to execution on a scaffold erected 
              outside the Banqueting Hall in Whitehall. The death warrant remained 
              in Colonel Hacker's possession until the restoration of Charles 
              II in 1660 when Hacker, then a prisoner in the Tower of London, 
              was ordered by the House of Lords to surrender the warrant to them. 
              Since then the document has remained in their custody. On the back 
              of the warrant is written in a 17th-century hand: 'The bloody Warr[an]t 
              for murthering the King'. <br>
              <br>
              The document is on a piece of parchment 43.8cm x 21cm. All the seals 
              are of red wax, some of them broken or obscured.</p>
