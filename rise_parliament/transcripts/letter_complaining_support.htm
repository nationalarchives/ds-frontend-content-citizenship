            countenanced divers smiths in and about Bermingham in their disobedience 
            concerning the payment of his Ma[jes]ties duty of Hearthmoney. It 
            will be easy for you to conceive how sensible the King must be to 
            hear of so great a branch of his Revenue endangered; and under the 
            countenance of one that hath always appeared not onely loyall but 
            affectionate to his Ma[jes]tys service as you have done. His Ma[jes]ty 
            hath upon the whole thought good to appoint me to signify his pleasure 
            to you, that you doe as speedily as you can repaire hither to appeare 
            at the Councill board to answer such objections as will be made to 
            you upon this particular: Which I hope you will doe so far to his 
            Ma[jes]ties satisfacion as you may be entirely restored to the former 
            place you had in his good opinion. I doubt not, Sir, of your compliance 
            with his Ma[jes]ties command in your speedy coming up; and I hope
