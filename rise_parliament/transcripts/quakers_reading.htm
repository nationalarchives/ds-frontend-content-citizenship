            of o[u]r hearts; That the Grounde &amp; Cause why wee Cannot take 
            an Oath in any Case (although it bee to the Losse of our Estats &amp; 
            Lives) is because Jesus Christ &amp; his Apostles, hath Comanded us 
            not to Sweare at all, And it is not Lawefull for us (in any Case) 
            to Breake Christs Comands, &amp; if any of yo[u]r Ministers, Doctors,
