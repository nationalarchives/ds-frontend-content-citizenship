            &amp; disinterested freindship [<em>sic</em>],I have been represented

            to his Majesty only, In a situation which perhaps is not common, I 
            have presumed to give your Grace the trouble of this Letter to signify 
            that I have the warmest sense of his Majestys goodnes And that I shall 
            execute the office committed to me With a Suitable Zeal for his Majestys 
            service &amp; the good of the Subject to the utmost of my power.</td>

            this the beginning of a new aera to Jurisdictions in this part of 
            the Island, I shou'd have had difficulty to undertake this imployment, 
            To be for at least four months in a year confined to a County far 
            removed from Ed[inbu]r[gh], And from my own Estate to which a retirement 
            is exceeding agreeable, are inconveniences not to be ballanc'd by 
            a Salary tho' much above what is annexed to this office. But as I 
            have long been of opinion That the Abolishing the heritable Jurisdictions 
            was a step proper to be taken in order to make the meanest subject 
            feel and relish the influences of liberty, And from my having spent 
            sometime in acquiring a little knowledge into these matters, was called 
            by his Majestys Advocate to be his Assistant in the late inquiry concerning 
            these Jurisdictions now abolishd; I should think it highly indecent 
            now when the change is to commence, upon account of any inconveniencies, 
            to decline taking a part in bringing so good a Law to execution and 
            satisfying the people that this new thing is greatly for their benefit. 
            These particulars I have taken the liberty to mention to your Grace 
            chiefly with a view to prevent it's being thought owing to ficklenes 
            or unconstancy if after things are Brought in to a Settled State hereafter 
            I shou'd humbly beg leave to resign. I am with the greatest respect</td>
