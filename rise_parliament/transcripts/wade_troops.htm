            Instant, the Commissioners of Excise here received Information a Day 
            or two before by Letters from several of their Officers at Glasgow, 
            that they were threatened to be stoned if they should attempt to take 
            an Account of the Stock of Malt in the Hands of any Person there; 
            and that some of the Towns People had laid at the Door of every Malt-House 
            great Heaps of Stones to convince the Officers they were in Earnest. 
            Hereupon the Commissioners made Application for some Troops to Major 
            General Wade Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Forces in this Part 
            of the Kingdom; who in Complyance with their Request sent from hence 
            Captain Bushel with two Companies of Delorain's Regiment of Foot, 
            to aid the Magistrates of the Town in case they should demand his 
            Assistance against any who should make a riot, and charging him strictly 
            not to resent any abusive Language, or proceed to any manner of Violence 
            unless he should be driven to Extremity. The two Companies marched 
            from this City on the 23rd Instant, and notwithstanding very great 
            Rains and the Distance of 40 Miles, they arrived in Glasgow about 
            six in the Evening of the 24th, when they found a Mob got together, 
            consisting chiefly of Women and Boys, who gave them the worst of Language 
            and threw Stones at them. But the Officer desired them to be quiet, 
            for that he was not come to do Harm to any Body. When he came into 
            the midst of the Town, he applied to the Provost that he might lodge 
            his Men, in the Guard-Room, the Provost answered, that the Mob had 
            secured the Key of the Guard-Room; and he could only give him Billets 
            for his Men. Whereupon the Officer, consented himself with hiring 
            a publick House for his Men. Not long after, a Drum being beat about 
            the Town by one of the Rioters, a vast Number of them drew together, 
            and about 11 at Night they began to break into the House of Mr. Daniel 
            Campbell of Shawfield, Representative in Parliament for the Town of 
            Glasgow, and destroyed or took away the Furniture and whatever they 
            found in it. Then they broke open his Cellars, drank themselves drunk, 
            and slaved the rest of his Wines. Captain Bushel had timely Intelligence 
            given him, that the Mob were going to plunder the said House; and 
            therefore kept himself ready with his Men in Expectation of being 
            called by the Provost to his Assistance; but not hearing any thing 
            from him, he dispatched an Officer to the Provost, to let him know 
            he was sent on Purpose to assist the Civil Magistrate on the Occasion, 
            but the Provost returned Answer, That he did not think he had a sufficient 
            Number of Men, and therefore he did not think fit to make use of them. 
            Thus the Mob gutted the House, and not one Magistrate to discountenance 
            their Violence; for some had withdrawn from the Town some Time before, 
            and the rest were, (or pretended to be) intimidated. The Officers 
            of the Excise had hid themselves, before and during the Riot; but 
            some of them were found out by the Rabble, and were unmercifully beaten 
            and abused. </td>
          <td width="50%"> <p>to amuse him till the Mob should draw nearer. The 
              Captain telling him he was not to be imposed upon, and bidding him 
              dismiss his People of whom he seemed to be the Head, the pretended 
              Woman ran away which was the Signal to fall on; For then came a 
              Shower of great Stones and Clubs at the Soldiers Heads, with a Continual 
              Cry of Drive the Dogs out of Town; They wounded several of them, 
              broke the Locks of some of their Arms, and told the Officer they 
              knew he durst not fire at them. The Captain with some Difficulty 
              prevailed with a Constable (for want of a Superior Magistrate) to 
              read the Proclamation against Rioters before any Harm was done by 
              the Soldiers; but the poor Man seeing himself in Danger when he 
              began to read it, threw the Proclamation down and ran away. Upon 
              this the Captain caused some of his Men to fire over their Heads, 
              in Hopes to terrify them without hurting them; but instead of his 
              finding that Effect from his Tenderness towards them, they fell 
              upon the Troops with redoubled Violence; so that the Captain was 
              at last obliged to order his Men to fire in their own Defence, by 
              which three or four of the Rioters were killed. Then the Mob retired 
              a little, and the Provost sent a Messenger to the Captain, desiring 
              him to retire with his Men out of the Town. The Officer complied; 
              but this Retreat gave new Spirit to the Rabble, and they pressed 
              upon him, he retiring in good Order, and sometimes firing, as Necessity 
              required, by which about Ten of the Rioters were killed, and several 
              wounded. </p>
            <p>The Mob pursued him about six Miles, there being 3 or 400 of them 
              armed with Firelocks, but durst not come near enough to him when 
              he was in the open Country, to kill any of his Men. And perceiving 
              he was making his Retreat towards Dunbarton Castle, they sent some 
              Horsemen full speed to threaten the People at Dunbarton, that if 
              they gave any Shelter to the Soldiers they would come and burn their 
              Town. Two of the Soldiers fell into their Hands in Glasgow, one 
              of whom they thought they had killed, but some time after a Woman 
              dragged him into a House and in about two Hours time recovered him 
              a little from the miserable Condition he was in by the Wounds he 
              had received. They came to a Resolution to hang the other; but a 
              Man, who was desirous to save him, told the Mob to amuse them, that 
              the best Way was to carry him to Shawfield's House and hang him 
              there. When they had dragged him thither, the Fellow told the Mob 
              again, that it was almost dark, and that it would be better to hang 
              him the next Morning by Day-light, for an Example to others. After 
              which, in the Night, he got the Soldier out of their Way. Four others 
              were missing by the Way in their Retreat, being fallen with the 
              Fatigue of their long Marches and their Wounds, but two of them 
              are since arrived at Dunbarton Castle: The other two cannot yet 
              be heard of. These are the chief Particulars, which we have received 
              by divers Letters, and by Persons come from Glasgow on this Occasion.</p></td>
