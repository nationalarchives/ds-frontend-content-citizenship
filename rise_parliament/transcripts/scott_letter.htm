          <td>From the New Taxes as they appear in the News papers the Corn Distiller 
            is to pay &pound;50:- for a Licence which will make it fall very unequal 
            especialy in this Country The Distiller in London &amp; other places 
            in England who have Large Stills &amp; a number of them Containing 
            4000: 5000 &amp; 6000 Gall[on]s &amp; more will not be hurt by the 
            Tax but in this Country where the Common run of the Stills are from 
            400: 600: 800 or a 1000 Gall:s 4 or 5 of the Distillers coupled who 
            have larger Stills the Distillers will be much hurt by the Tax as 
            &pound;50..- is what they will not be able to pay when a Tax is to 
            be laid on it Should be done in the most equall manner which is not 
            the Case with the intended Tax upon Corn Distillers. Being persuaded 
            the Chancellor of the Exchequer wishes to make the Tax fall as equal 
            as is possible I would therefore Humbly propose the following mode 
            of laying it on the Corn Distillers have more Stills than one some 
            have 2:3:4 or more if they were to pay 20/ 30/ or 40 Shillings for 
            every Hundred Gallons the whole of there Stills Contain it would be 
            a more equall Tax and raise more money to Government than the intend 
            Tax of &pound;50..- If the intended mode of Taxation of &pound;50:- 
            for a Licence takes place many of the Distillers must give up the 
            Business as the above mode of Taxation will be more equal and raise 
            more money to Government I am fond to thing [ <i>sic</i>] think the 
            Chancellor of the exchequer would addopt it if it was proposed to 
            him Your endevouring to make the above mode for the Tax take place 
            will be a particular favour done to the Distillers in General in this 
            Country and real Service done to the revenew I am</td>
