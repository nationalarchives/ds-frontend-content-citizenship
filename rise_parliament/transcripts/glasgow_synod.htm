            I expressed in my Letter of the 21st were but too well founded. Last 
            Night a considerable Mob rose <span class="strikethru"> last night</span> 
            , and set Fire to an House which the Papists employed as a Chapple, 
            and attacked that where Mr Hay (titular Bishop of Edinburgh) resided. 
            The Magistrates, supported by 250 of the Military, prevented any further 
            Excesses for that time, and took four of them Prisoners: But the Tumult 
            has by no means subsided. This morning the Magistrates inform me that 
            the Mob threaten the Houses of Principal Robinson, the Lord Advocate, 
            and Councellor Crosbie, supposeing them Friends to the Popery Bill, 
            and of Lord Linton as a Roman Catholick. I have endeavoured to convince 
            them that Men of no Denomination are safe from the Outrages of a Mob 
            bent upon Mischeif; and they promise to exert themselves with vigour: 
            which, if attended with Success, may prevent the Flame from spreading 
            through the Country. To Morrow I shall, probably, be able to form 
            a better Judgement what Turn this mischeivous beginning is likely 
            to take: but I thought it my Duty to apprise your Lordship, by Express, 
            of what has allready happen'd.</td>
