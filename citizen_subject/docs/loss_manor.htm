            the Birmingham family in lieu of debts owed to him and in consideration 
            of felonies committed by Edward Birmingham. The felony charge may 
            have been trumped up, since Edward's neighbour and rival Lord Dudley 
            brought the initial charge to the attention of Cardinal Wolsey. From 
            this position of weakness, Edward Birmingham did very badly in his 
            deal with the king. In exchange for his land, Edward is pardoned and 
            he and his wife are allowed by 'the king's highness of his blessed 
            disposition and benign goodness' only &pound;20 a year in rents from 
            their former land. By the time of his release, Edward had spent 180 
            weeks as a prisoner in the Tower of London.<br>
