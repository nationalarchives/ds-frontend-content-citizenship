          <td>The years 1349-51 saw the introduction of a series of statutes designed 
            to peg the prices that could be charged for labour and trades at pre-plague 
            levels, and to control the movement of workers, especially agricultural 
            labourers. Local gentry, who were entitled to try local cases, used 
            this and other laws to enforce their authority. Moreover, any fines 
            they levied were set against their own tax contributions. 
            <p>In 1361, when the first justices of the peace were created, the 
              local gentry also acquired the right to hear and determine cases 
              concerning particular categories of crime. This made them much more 
              powerful within the local community, and increased their ability 
              to intervene in the lives of their poorer neighbours. By measures 
              such as these, the ruling elites were able to limit the enhanced 
              economic power gained by the workforce as a result of the plague 
              years. <br>
