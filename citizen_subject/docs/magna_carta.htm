          <td> Magna Carta (Latin for 'Great Charter') was the brainchild of Stephen 
            Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury (c.1150-1228). To combat King John's 
            attacks on the church, ill-advised foreign policies, and excessive 
            demands for <a href="../../glossary.htm#feudalaids" target="_blank">feudal 
            aids<img src="../../graphics/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens new window" width="6" height="13" border="0"></a> 
            and <a href="../../glossary.htm#feudalincidents" target="_blank">feudal 
            incidents<img src="../../graphics/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens new window" width="6" height="13" border="0"></a>, 
            in 1213 he suggested that the barons should draw up a binding '<a href="../../glossary.htm#charter" target="_blank">charter<img src="../../graphics/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens new window" width="6" height="13" border="0"></a> 
            of liberties', to protect themselves and other subjects from unreasonable 
            actions on the part of the Crown. 
            <p>Eventually, on 12 June 1215, the barons forced John to meet them 
              at Runnymede, a large meadow beside the Thames, in Surrey; and after 
              several days of negotiation he reluctantly agreed to affix his seal 
              to the charter. Copies of it were then delivered by messengers to 
              every county in the realm.</p>
            <p>Although some of the charter's 63 clauses have little relevance 
              today, others safeguard basic civil liberties. During Tudor times 
              it was practically forgotten, being regarded as a relic of the feudal 
              era. But in the 17th century it was rescued from oblivion by the 
              <a href="../../glossary.htm#parliamentarians" target="_blank">Parliamentarians<img src="../../graphics/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens new window" width="6" height="13" border="0"></a>, 
              who recognised its humanitarian and democratic qualities - and in 
              the 20th century it inspired some of the articles of the Universal 
              Declaration of Human Rights issued by the United Nations in 1948.</p>
            <p>Magna Carta was reissued in 1216 by William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke 
              (regent for the nine-year-old Henry III), with the omission of a 
              number of clauses that he judged unreasonable from the sovereign's 
              point of view. Further revisions were made in 1217 and 1225. The 
              third version of Magna Carta - the final version that entered the 
              statute books - is reproduced here.<br>
