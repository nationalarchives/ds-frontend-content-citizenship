          <td> At Christmas 1085 William the Conqueror commissioned a detailed 
            survey of lands held by himself and his subjects. Each <a href="../../glossary.htm#shire" target="_blank">shire<img src="../../graphics/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens new window" width="6" height="13" border="0"></a> 
            was visited by royal commissioners who asked searching questions about 
            the extent, use, ownership and value of the land - which aroused widespread 
            resentment, and in some areas rioting. 
            <p>The resulting record, running to 900 pages and 2 million words 
              of Latin, describes more than 13,000 places in England and Wales, 
              the majority of which survive today. Originally it was kept at Winchester 
              and was known as the Winchester Roll or King's Roll, but the native 
              English nicknamed it the Domesday Book, after the biblical Day of 
              Judgement, when every soul would be assessed and against which there 
              could be no appeal. </p>
            <p>The first stage was to compile what is now called Little Domesday, 
              covering Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, which was written up, neatly 
              though hurriedly, by at least six scribes during the course of 1086. 
              Although smaller in format than Great Domesday, it is less concise 
              and includes detail about livestock. </p>
            <p>Great Domesday was written up by one scribe, with annotations by 
              a second. It was intended that it should cover the rest of England, 
              excluding northern Lancashire and the far north of England, which 
              were not yet fully under Norman control. Space was left for several 
              important boroughs (towns), such as London, Winchester, Bristol 
              and Tamworth, but work on the project was abandoned in 1090, without 
              entries for them being filled in.<br>
