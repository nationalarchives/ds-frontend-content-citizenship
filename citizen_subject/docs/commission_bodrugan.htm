          <td>Outlawry normally resulted when the authorities were unable to apprehend 
            an individual for a civil or criminal offence. The sheriff would be 
            directed to arrest the wanted man, and if this failed he would make 
            five declarations in the county court summoning the offender to appear. 
            If the fugitive remained at large, he would then be outlawed. Following 
            parliamentary censure (which had been used against Bodrugan), similar 
            procedures were brought into operation. Consequently, Bodrugan was 
            threatened with the loss of his rights under the law and the confiscation 
            of his lands and goods. The question that arises from this case, though, 
            is whether the outlawry process actually mattered at all? An inveterate 
            criminal, Bodrugan successfully flouted the law on numerous occasions 
            and was never effectively brought to account for his crimes.<br>
