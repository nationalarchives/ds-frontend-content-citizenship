          <td>Sir Thomas More is often seen as a victim of Henry VIII's monstrous 
            personality. As a lawyer of great ability, he had been at the centre 
            of Henry's government from 1523, when he became the speaker of Parliament. 
            As Lord Chancellor (from 1529), More was not convinced that Henry's 
            wish for a divorce from Catherine of Aragon was in the interests of 
            either the king or the realm, and used his position to oppose Henry's 
            wishes. More's largely silent protest meant that he could not be convicted 
            of overt treason, but he was eventually executed in 1534 for persistently 
            refusing to swear the <a href="oath_allegiance.htm" target="_blank">oath 
            of allegiance</a>. The Act of <a href="../../glossary.htm#attainder" target="_blank">Attainder<img src="../../graphics/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens new window" width="6" height="15" border="0"></a> 
            used against him shows that, although Parliament was the highest court 
            of the land, it could be overawed by strong monarchs into endorsing 
            their particular wishes and desires.<br>
