          <td> <p>Illegal hunting was damaging because it destroyed the valuable 
              warrens, parks and chases of lords' estates. But it also provided 
              an opportunity for secret meetings of the lower orders, where conspiracies 
              and seditious gossip could be exchanged beyond the reach of authority. 
            </p>
            <p>For much of the later medieval period, the danger from secret gatherings 
              of peasants was more worrying to the Crown and nobility than the 
              loss of game. After the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and further rebellions 
              of the lower orders, such as Jack Cade's rising of 1450 and the 
              Western Rebellion of 1497, numerous laws and proclamations were 
              made to restrict hunting and to prevent gatherings of groups of 
              tenants and servants. </p>
            <p>This Act of 1390 neatly involved the church, too, since many conspirators, 
              under the guise of hunting, enjoyed their crimes when loyal and 
              honest citizens were at church. The aim of this Act and many others 
              - such as 'sumptuary laws' restricting the colours and material 
              of garments allowed to different social levels - was to ensure that 
              economic status would be the sole criterion determining whether 
              individuals were able to enter the upper echelons of society and 
              enjoy the benefits thus conferred. <br>
