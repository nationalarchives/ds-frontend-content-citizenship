          <td>By the time of James's accession to the throne of England in 1603 
            only Parliament could offer this kind of fulsome welcome and endorsement 
            to an incoming monarch. The members were said to be 'on the knees 
            of their hearts' to bid James welcome to his new realm. 
            <p>The final sentence of the oath encapsulates the progress Parliament 
              had made in the previous three centuries. By 1603, the idea of the 
              realm as a living organism - the body politic - had taken firm hold 
              as a metaphor for the population of the nation as a whole. Indeed 
              the function of Parliament had been refined to the point that it 
              was regarded as representing every member of the nation, as if each 
              individual citizen was there in person. </p>
            <p>As the representative institution of England and Wales, Parliament 
              legitimised and endorsed key constitutional and political changes. 
              This document also shows that, on occasion, it was prepared to stretch 
              the truth about the past to accommodate the needs of the present.
