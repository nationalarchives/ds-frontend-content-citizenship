          <td> <p>These two Acts illustrate ways in which the Tudor state dealt 
              with economic and social problems. </p>
            <p>Henry VII's Act for the repressing of riots is an example of his 
              attempts to deal with law and order. It deals with the issue of 
              civil disorder, which had been a characteristic of the period dominated 
              by the Wars of the Roses and remained so throughout the 16th century. 
              In addition, it refers to the role of Justices of the Peace - who 
              were given more powers during Henry's reign - and also that of juries, 
              which tended to be corrupt and liable to intimidation. </p>
            <p>Later in the century, economic problems and plague outbreaks were 
              the cause of large numbers of people moving about the countryside, 
              looking for work and for places to live free from the risk of infection. 
              That they were perceived as a threat to law and order is clear from 
              the first section of the Act for the punishment of vagabonds (dealing 
              with their treatment by the legal system, which attempted to limit 
              people to their own parishes). That there remained a welfare issue 
              is also demonstrated by the Act. The <a href="../../glossary.htm#dissolution" target="_blank">dissolution 
              of the monasteries<img src="../../graphics/glossary.gif" alt="Glossary - opens new window" width="6" height="13" border="0"></a> 
              by Henry VIII had removed a source of charitable aid, and the Act 
              represents a move away from religious to state support for the poor. 
              In the later section of the Act reproduced here, a mechanism for 
              the welfare of the poor is detailed: they were to be recorded and 
              supported by a tax on the local inhabitants.<br>
