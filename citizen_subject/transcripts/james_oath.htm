      <p>Great and manifold were the benefits (most dread and most gracious sovereign) 
        wherewith almighty God blessed this kingdom and nation by the happy union 
        and conjunction of the two noble houses of York and Lancaster, thereby 
        preserving this noble realm, formerly torn and wasted with long and miserable 
        dissention and bloody civil war, but most inestimable and unspeakable 
        blessings are thereby poured upon us because there is derived and grown 
        from and out of that union of those two princely families a more famous 
        and greater Union (or rather a reuniting) of two mighty famous and ancient 
        Kingdoms (yet anciently but one) of England and Scotland under one imperial 
        crown, in your most royal person, who is lineally rightfully and lawfully 
        descended of the body of the most excellent lady Margaret, eldest daughter 
        of the most renowned King Henry VII and the high and noble princess Queen 
        Elizabeth his wife, eldest daughter of King Edward IV; the said lady Margaret 
        being eldest Sister of King Henry VIII, father of the high and mighty 
        princess of famous memory, Elizabeth late Queen of England; In consideration 
        whereof, albeit we your majesties loyal and faithful subjects, of all 
        estates and degrees with all possible and public joy and acclamation,

        and upon the knees of our hearts to agonise our most constant faith, obedience 
        and loyalty to your majesty and your royal progeny, as in this high court
