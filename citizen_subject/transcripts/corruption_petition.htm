      <p>To the right honourable and most discreet council<br>
        Of the king our sovereign lord</p>
      <p> Show unto your right honourable and wise discreet John Duke of Norfolk 
        that where at the shire (court) to be held at Ipswich in the shire of 
        Suffolk the Monday next after the feast of St Valentine last past there 
        came diverse tenants and servants of the said Duke to the election of 
        the knights of the shire for the last parliament there for to have given 
        their voice to the knights of the shire after the law of this land. There 
        Thomas Sharnburn, at that time sheriff of the said shire imagining and 
        proposing to make knights of the shire after his own intent and for his 
        singular covetousness and to hurt the servants and tenants of the said 
        Duke has returned in the Common Pleas a 'rescous' of many and diverse 
        servants and tenants of the said Duke whose names are annexed to this 
        bill, surmising by his return that his officers dare not hold the shire 
        [court] previously said because of menace and threats made to his said 
        officers as he returned in the Common Pleas previously said. Where that 
        the said servants and tenants of the said Duke never made any such manner 
        of force, rescue or menace as the said sheriff has returned but that they 
        peacefully came to the shire house for the election of the knights of 
        the shire after the law of the land. Wherefore please it your right wise 
        and noble discreet to send our sovereign lords letters to the Justices 
        of the Common Pleas commanding them to admit all the servants and tenants 
        of the said Duke contained in the said bill to appear by attorney and 
        to answer by attorney, considering them to admit all the servants and 
        tenants which are innocent persons [to] be returned in the said 'rescous' 
        against all manner of reason and conscience of the which diverse and many 
        were not there at that time as it shall sufficiently be proved at the 
        reverence of God in the day of charity.</p>
