            <p>&#8216;Citizenship: a history of people, rights and power in Britain&#8217;
              explores the development of the rights and responsibilities of subjects
              and citizens throughout a millennium of British history. The broad
              theme addressed here is the shaping of relations between the individual
              and the state. Within this, &#8216;Citizenship&#8217; looks at struggles
              to attain political, economic and social rights and how the state
              dealt with them; at the engagement of the population with the state;
              and at changing definitions of citizenship and citizens. </p>

            with a general interest in history, citizenship or local history,
            or involved in formal study), the exhibition presents a selection
            of fascinating documents from The National Archives and Parliamentary
            Archives, many of them made available online for the first time. Each
            document is explained and firmly set in its historical context, providing
            a unique insight into the past as seen through the records of the
            time.</td>

          <td width="50%" align="left"> <p>&#8216;Citizenship&#8217; looks at
              the changing demands for collective and individual rights as Britain
              - and, before that, England, Scotland and Wales - ceased to be a
              static and interdependent feudal society and became an industrialised
              and then post-industrial one. It explores ideas of what the subject
              or citizen owed to the state, whether in terms of feudal dues, obedience
              to the law, or payment of taxes. And it looks at the shifting dividing
              line between citizens and non-citizens, whether between &#8216;subjects&#8217;
              and &#8216;aliens&#8217; (including Scots in England) in the medieval
              period or those divided into three groups by the British Nationality

            marriage alliances, and the Acts of Union of 1707 and 1800. In more
            recent times, the development of Britain as an imperial power and
            the subsequent entry of post-imperial Britain into Europe raised new
            questions regarding the nature of British citizenship. </td>

              research purposes the transcripts are not a substitute for examining
              the original documents. In the transcripts, obvious typing errors
              have occasionally been corrected for the sake of clarity and in
              places extraneous notes have been omitted. </p>

              where necessary in the transcript the 'missing' letters have been
